mebant. atque illi modo cauti ac sapientes prompti post
eventum ac magniloqui erant. iniquissima haec bellorum

'm - 28. Eadem aestate cohors Usiporum per Germanias con-

1. praelium: text R.

cp. ‘ longius penetrata Germania ’ (Α. 4.
44, 3). This transitive use is first found

fl in prose in Veli. 2. 40, ι.

1. tremebant, ‘were clamorously

s, · demanding: Dr. gives a list of collec-

ν tives taking a plural verb in Tacitus, as

 

ν ‘ inventus’ ‘ manus,’ ⁴ multitudo‚' ‘ pars‚’

‘ plebs‚’ ‘ vexillum‚’ ‘ vulgus,' also the
pronouns ‘ quisque ¹ and ‘ uterque.’

2. mi, the ‘ignavi specie prudentium ’
osc. 25,3. ⁴ Magniloquus‚’ here alone in
Tacitus, is apparently in no earlier prose,
and first in Ovid.

4. prospera, &a The same senti-
ment is put into the mouth of Tiberius
(A. 3. 53, 4), a similar one into that of
Titus (H. 4. 52, 2). Both may have
been suggested by Sallust's maxim (Jug.
53, 8), ‘ in victoria vel ignavis gloriari
licet, adversae res etiam bonos detrac-

5. non virtute se. The omission
of ⁸ se ’ could be defended (cp. A. 4. 59,
5, and note). but it is very oesy to sup-
pose that it has dropped out here; and
not so easy to account sor its loss below,
if the gap (perhaps indicated by a dot
in Γ) is rightly filled by ‘ victos‚' as the
very similar words in H. 2. 44, 5 (‘ non

κ virtute se sed proditione victum’), and

2. 76, 8 (‘ ne Othonem quidem *ducis

· me aut exercitus vi, sed praepropera

ipsius desperatione victum ), suggest:
⁸ elusos,’ meaning rather ‘out-manneu-
vred,' seems inappropriate. It is pos-
sible that more words are lost, giving

,more fully their way of putting their

4. uindicant Γ.

5. se ins. Waleh. 6. victos
10. usipiorum (and

θ

occasione et, arte ducis, ‘through
a chance skilfully turned to account by
the general,’ i. e. the discovery of their
design by Agricola and his prompt
action on it.

6. nihil, &c.‚ ‘abated none of their

pride’ z cp. ‘ nihil e solito luxu remit—
ten3,' H. 3. 55, 2. For ‘quo minus ’ cp.
c. 20, 2. ’

8. commi-ationem . .
‘ ratisy the union.'

9. atque ita, διε. Cp. ‘atque ita in·
sensis utrimque animis discessum ' (A. 1 3.
56, 3), where a colloquy had taken
place. Here it probably means that
they went off to winter-quarters.

10. Eadem aestate. The introduc-
tion of this episode, which, though it
would have found part in any general
history of the campaigns, lies outside
the biographical subject, has seemed
strange to critics. It may have been
inserted, as Gantrelle thinks, to relieve
the monotonous narrative of warsare.
1t serves also to show that Agricola
had troops who were a source not of
strength but of weakness, and the pos-
sible contagion of whose example (cp.
c. 32, 4) had to be guarded against.
The story is related briefly from some
other source by Dio (66. 20, 2) as
suggesting Agricola's circumnavigation
of the island.
