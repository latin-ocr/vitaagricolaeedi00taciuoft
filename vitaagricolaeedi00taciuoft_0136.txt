they can hardly be an explanatory gloss

to bracket ‘nam . . . firmabantur '). As
they stand here, they are somewhat
supported by ‘ hieme . . . pellebantur’

1. sibi quisque praesidio, i. e. none
stood in need of any help from outside.

irritis, ‘baffled '; so used of persons
in poets and post· Augustan prose: cp.
A. 3. 21, 6, &c.

3. eventibus, ‘successes cp. c. 8,
2; 27, 2; A. 2. 26, 3(andnote).

pensare, ‘to counterbalanee’: cp.
A. 2. 26, 1, &c., a post· Augustam use
for‘ compensare.'

iuxta, a‘like,' an adverbial use

mainly founded on Sall„ frequent in
Hist. and Anu„ but here alone in the
minor works.

4. intercepit, ‘took credit to him-
self for.’ Dr. notes the use of ‘honos
interceptus ' in Cic. Leg. Agr. 2. 2, 3.
⁴ Avidus ’ is adverbial.

5. habebat, ‘used to have in him?

6. apud: cp. c. 21, 3.

ut erat, ‘as in fact he was’ ε ‘ita,’

‘on the other hand’ (cp. e. 6, 45 32, 1;
33, 5, &c.). Henrichsen’sreading would
resemble c. 10, 4; A. 2. 57, 2 (¹ et erat
clementior'), but is not needed.
