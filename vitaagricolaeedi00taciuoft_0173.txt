(‘ in plain words'). So‘ occultus’ is
used of a person who coneeals his
thoughts,H. 2. 38,4: cp.A.6 51, 5.

paratus simulatione, ‘having
studied his part with hypocrisy,' i. e.
with pretended ignorance of any pres-
sure put upon Agricola. Such an abl.
might be called instrumental or one of
respect: cp. ‘paratum peditatu, equi-
tatu? &c., Cic. Att. 9. Ι34; ‘sermone
paratus? Suet. Cl. 42.

easily have dropped out here3 on the
other hand Tacitus often omits it: see

neo erubuit, &c., ‘did not blush for
the odiousness of the concession’ ;for
granting as a favour what was really the
gratification of his own dislike. yThe
abl. is causal, as in G. 28, 5. A. notes
a similar sarcasrn in H. 1. 21. 1 (‘ exilii
honorem ’). The emendation ‘iniuria’
is not needed.

8. salarium, &c. This substantive
is not found earlier than Sen. and Plin.
ma.; its use dates from the Augustan
regulations by which all provincial
governors had fixed pay on a scale pro-
portioned to their rank: cp. Dio, 52.

quardt‚ Staatsv. i. 558 ; ii. 108.

proconsuli consulari. This emen-
dation appears almost certain. The
manuscript text cannot stand, and
the emendation‘ proconsulare' would
suppose that the salaries of all procon-
suls were the same, and leaves‘ offerri'
without a dative. It is stated in Dio
78. 22, 5, that in A.D. 217 a pronconsul
of Africa who declined the province
received a million H. S.
