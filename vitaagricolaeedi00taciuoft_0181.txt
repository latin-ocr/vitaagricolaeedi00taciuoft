a famous blind accuser, eloquently de-
scribed in Plin. Ep. 4. 22, 5, and in Juv.
4, 113—122, who calls him ‘mortifer,’
and ‘grande et conspicuum nostro
qnoque tem re monstrum ’ (see Mayor,
ad loc.). e< died apparently before
Domitian (Plin. l. 1.).

ΑΛ). 70, as then a procurator of Αἰτίαι,
‘iam tnnc optimo cuique exitiosus, et
inter causas malorum, quae mox tulimus,
saepius reditums' (H. 4. 50, 3). The
schol. on JuV. 1, 35, makes him, as
also Carus and Latinus, to have been
among the fieedmen buffoons of Nero’s
court.

’ [iun] tum reus. Pliny, who was
deputed by the senate, with Senecio, to
accuse him sor misconduct in the ad-
ministration of Hispania Baetica, gives
an account of the prooeedings to Tacitus
for insertion in the Histories (Ep. 7. 333
cp. also 3. 4, 4; 6. 29, 8). He was

, condemned, bnt turned upon Senecio

with a of ‘impietas.’ We see
here that hia trial was pending at the
time οἱ Agricola’s death, whose last
days were thus cheered by the belief
that this formidable person would be
mshed. It seems probable that Δ
has here preserved the right-reading, as
‘iam tum’ would imply that Massa
was on the wane and tending to come
to nothing; the fact being that he was
only under a tempor-ary eclipse.
nostrae. those os senators. Tacitus
treats as the act of the whole order,
including himself (cp. Introd. p. 15),

what may have been that of one person
only 3 as Publicius Certus was especially
noted for having laid hands on H elvidius,
and was attacked by Pliny aster the
death of Domitian (see Ep. 9. 13).
He says (ξ 2), ‘nullum (scelus) atrocius
videbatur quam quod in senatu senator
senatori, praetorius consulari, reo iudex
manus intulisset!

2. Helvidium, son of the Helvidius
of c. 2, 1, and stepson of F annia (Plin.
Ep. 9. 13, 3). He was indicted sor an
imaginary allusion to Domitian in a
tragedy written by him (Suet. Dom. ιο),
and put to death. Pliny mentions
(l. l. ξ 4) his wife Anteia, and wrote
a treatise in vindication of him (Ep. 7.
30, 4; 9·13‚ 1)· ,

nos, &c. The marginal text here
adopted (with Andresen), like some
others introduced by ‘ al‚' may possibly
have some further authority than (as
Halm calls it) the unhappy conjecture
of Laetus (see lntrod. p. 2, n. 4), and,
even if only a conjecture, gives a good
and pathetic meaning: ‘ we parted the
brothers' (sentencing one to death, the
other to exile). With the alternative
reading, supposing ‘visus' to denote
their appearance as criminals, such a

sudit' seems, like the ellipse suggested
in c. 44, 5, beyond anything used by
Tacitus even in this treatise3 and the
addition of ‘horrore' or ‘ pavore' (for
which Dr. compares Liv. 26. 50, 9),
besides being violent, still leaves a harsh
double use os‘ perfudit‚’ hardly paralleled
by Plin. Pan. 2 (⁸ lacrimis . . . ac . . .
pudore suffunditur’). Also, while there
is ground for contrasting Rusticus with
Mauricus, there is no reason for con-
trasting him with Senecio, as both were
put to death, and ⁴ ine perfudit ¹
would be as (rhetorically) true of the
one as of the other.
