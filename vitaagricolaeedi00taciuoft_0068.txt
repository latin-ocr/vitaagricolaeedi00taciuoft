We are told that he at once began his rule by the most difficult of l
all reforms‚ that of his own establishment‚ dealing directly and openlyff
and with full recognition of antecedents, in his dispensation of
patronage, and observing a just sense of proportion in the treatment
of offences¹ (virtues which might well seem commonplace but for the
implied suggestion that they were exceptional)‚ and that even from his ’ᾗ
first year he took measures to abolish inequalities of incidence and
other vexatious anomalies tending to make the levying of the tribute Ῐ
and corn supply more profitable to the officials and burdensome to .
the taxpayer ².

Again, as regards the promotion of the arts and appliances of peace
and Roman culture, he is credited with what amounts to a new depar-
ture in policy³. We are led to suppose that the history of Roman?
Britain had been as yet one of military progress only. Most of the
Britons who may have at the outset adopted Roman ways are prob-
ably to be reckoned among the victims of the massacre of mn. 61 ⁴,
and the years passed since had apparently been marked by little ‚.
more than restoration of authority and order and fresh extensions
Ἴ of dominion. But Agricola, as we are told, at once saw the wisdom of-
promoting a rivalry amon he various communities in the erection of
temples‚ market-places‚ mansions ⁶. Of the first, the temple to Claudius
’ at Camulodunum⁶ is the only one previously on record ; the second,
besides facilitating trade and other intercourse for business, might
osten form the nuclei of towns, especially at important road centres ; ·
in the third we trace the beginning of the villas, the later remains
of which are among the most interesting relies of Roman Britain ⁷.
Nor was this all. Following the example set in other provinces ⁸, he
established seminaries for the instruction of highbom youths in the
Latin tongue‚ and encouraged their rivalry with the attainments of the ⁷

³ See c. 21, and notes. This policy
is dated from the winter of A. D. 79, and
is no doubt to be regarded as continued
throughout his rule, and must have
taken some time to develop itself.

serished ‘socii ’ as well as ‘ cives' are
reckoned (A. 14. 33, 5).

⁷ Several of these. especially the
great villa at Bignor, Sussex, and others

in Gloucestershire, Somerset, Dorset‚ .
and Lineolnshire, are described and
s plendidly illustrated m S. Lysons’ great
work‘ Reliquiae Britannico-Romanae,'

1813-1817. Many others have been
discovered since, among which perhaps ⁷
the best known is that near Brading in
the Isle of Wig ht. Most, if not all, of
these are of late Roman date.
