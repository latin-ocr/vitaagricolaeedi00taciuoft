Agricolam codicillos, quibus ei Suria dabatur, tulisse, cum
praecepto ut, si in Britannia foret, traderentur3 eumque liber-

brevi osculo, ‘a hasty kiss'; so in

59, 2. The custom of greeting with
a kiss the emperor's more intimate and
more distinguished friends appears to
have been introduced by Augustus,
probably from the East, and checked
by Tiberius (Suet. Tib. 34). See Fried-
laender, Sitteng. i. p. 141.

10. inmixtus, perhaps best taken,
with Peter, passively3 ‘he was mixed
up with the courtier crowd,' thought no

11. grave inter otiosos. A. seems
rightfully to take this to mean that
idlers were apt to glorify such a man,
and bring him into peril; it might also
mean that they envied and disliked his
fame: ‘ inter‚’ i. e. ‘cum omnes otiosi
essent ’ς cp. c. 32, ’4.
