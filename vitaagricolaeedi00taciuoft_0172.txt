CORNELII TACITI AGRICOLAE

aures verberatas, dum optimus quisque libertorum amore et*
fide, pessimi malignitate et livore pronum deterioribus prin-

cipem exstimulabant.

sic Agricola simul suis virtutibus,

simul vitiis aliorum in ipsam gloriam praeceps agebatur.
42. Aderat iam annuS, quo proconsulatum Africae et Asiae
sortiretur, et occiso Civica nuper nec Agricolae consilium

deerat nec Domitiano exemplum.

4. ipsa gloria (without in) Madvig, inter ipsam gloriam Bahrens.

‘ ceterorum’ ‘ Aliorum ’ is used below,
and Tacitus would probably have pre-
ferred not to use it in both places.
Halm’s suggestion rests on the suppo-
sition that a scribe skipped from one
‘ quibus’ to another.

1. aures verberatas, a figure taken
from Plautus (Amph. 1. l, 177, &c.).

dum, probably best taken as only
temporal (‘ whilst'): cp. H. 1. 1, 13
A. 13. 3, 1 τ it has also in Tacitus a
causal force (⁴ inasmuch as ')‚ but only
with the present.

libertorum, sc. ‘ Caesaris)

amore et. fide. A. takes these abla-
tives (cp. H. 2. 7, 3) as causal (the
‘amor‘ and ‘ fides ' being towards Do-
mitian), ‘malignitate et livore’ as in-
strumentaL and ‘ exstimulabant ⁹ as used
strictly with the latter, and by zeugma,
in the sense of ‘ adhortabantur' with
the former.

2. deterioribus, to be taken as
neut.; ‘PLssn-an' bein ⁴ffied when

27, 2), ‘promptus’ (A. 2. 78, 1), διο,
On the fondness oi Tacitus for neuter
plural adjectives cp. A. 3. 18, 6, and note.

3. simul . . . simul: cp. c. 25, 13
36, 1. A similar antithesis is noted in
H. 4. 34, 5 ‘non minus vitiis hostium
qnam sua virtute fretus? Here the
‘ inertia ⁷ and ‘ formido ’ os other generals
may be called ‘vitia‘; or perhaps the
reference is rather to the ‘ malignitas
et livor.‘

4. in ipsam gloriam. If the text
is sound this must be taken to imply
that in being forced into glory he was
also forced into all the perils belonging
to it (cp. c. 5, 43 and ‘ famam fatumque:
c. 42, 4); but we should expect some

5. Asiae
7. aderat Δ.

mention of this, like ‘ unde gloria egre-
giis viris et pericula gliscebant ’ (A. 15.
2 3, 6). With Madvig's reading, ¹ prae-
ceps ⁷ would be taken as in A. . 62, 3;
6. 17, 4: that of Bahrens wou d mean
‘ in the very midst of his glorification’ ;
while he was thus being glorified.

5. quo proconsulatum, &c. These
two, the highest and most valuable of
the senatorIal provinces, were awarded
every year to the two senior consulars
who had not held either ; the lot deter-
mining which was to have which. But
sometimes one or other was given ‘ extra
sortem’ (cp. A. 3. 32, and notes), or a
candidate was prohibited by the prin-
ceps (A. 6. 40, 3), or declined it, as did
Salvius Liberalis under Trajan (Inscr.
Or. 1170). From comparison of other
instances, it is thought that the tum of
Agricola would have fallen about twelve
or thirteen years after his consulship, i. e.
about A. D. 89 or 90.

6. sortireturz ‘ sortiri debebat!

Civica, the Civica Cerialis of Suet.
Dom. 10, and Sex. Vettulenus Cerialis
of an inscription at Venafrum (C. Ι. L. x.
4862), a legatus legionis in the Jewish
war (Jos. B. J. 6. 4, 3). There is no
record of his consulship, which may
have been in about A.1). 73 ,or 74, after
which another inscription (see A.’s note)
shows him as legatus of Moesia in the
the time of Vespasian. Suet. states (l. 1.)
that he was put to death by Domitian
during his proconsulate of Asia, which
may have been a year or two before the
turn of Agricola.

consilium, ‘ a waming’ (to show the
wisdom of declining it).

7. exemplum, ‘a precedent ' (to do
again what he had already sasely done) ε
so ‘ vestra exempla’ (A. 3. 50, 2), ‘par-
ricidii exemplum' (A. 13. 16, 6), &c.
