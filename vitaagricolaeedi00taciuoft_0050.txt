suzerainty in Britain as that of Divitiacus‚ king of the Suessiones, a '2

little before Caesar's time ¹, and the same close intercourse is attested
by the fact that the Gallie resistance to Caesar received constant aid
from Britain ².

Evidence of a considerable development of art in Britain in the
latest pre-Roman times is afforded by the discovery of a cemetery -at
Aylesford in Kent ³, where the burnt bones are deposited in wheel-
made urns of elegant design ⁴, with which are found bronze vessels
with ‘ repousse ' designs of elaborate and tasteful workmanship. The
pottery appears to have been baked on the spot ⁵3 and the whole find

 

shows the adoption and cultivation in Britain of the ‘ Late Celtic ’ art ἐ
derived by the Gauls from that of the Illyrian and Venetic district on ἶ

the Adriatic ⁶, itself a survival of the very early art called ‘ Mycenaean,’
modified by various later influences ⁷.

It will thus be seen that at least a large part of the island had 3
reached before the invasion of Caesar a much higher level of civilization ,

than is generally supposed. Of that invasion itself it is sufficient here
to say that his first expedition made no real advance beyond the
landing-place ⁸, and that in his second ⁹, though he crossed the
T hames, took the town of Cassivellaunus ¹⁰, exacted hostages‚ and

nominally imposed a tribute, he is rightly said to have been rather the ,

discoverer of the country than its conqueror ¹¹.

³ A full account of this find, with
illustrations‚ is given by Mr. A. J. Evans
in Archaeologia, vol. lii. The date is
taken to be in the earlier half of the
first century B.C.; coins of that period
being found on the spot, and the absence
of all Roman articles being against a
later date. Cremation had been com-
mon in the bronze age (see Boyd Daw-
kins, p. 367), and prevailed still more in
‘Late Celtic’ times, with the further
change that the bones were deposited
not in barrows but in shallow circular
pits in the flat; several pits being often
grouped together, probably as belonging
to the same family. Many such ceme-
teries had been found in Gaul, but none
previously in Britain.
