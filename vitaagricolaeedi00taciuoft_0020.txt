4 JNTR ODUCTION

It is thought most probable that it was printed from a careless
transcript of the same MS. from which Γ was copied, and that it has
no independent value.

The other supposed authority is that of Fulvio Orsini, who, in
a volume containing miscellaneous critical notes on several authors¹,
gives some forty pages to Tacitus, and, of the minor works, deals
chiefly with the Agricola. Several of his emendations are expressly
offered as his own, others as conjectures of Danesius ; but for others
the authority of a ‘v. c.' (‘ vetus codex ⁹) is cited. Two editors of
Cicero, Orelli and Madvig, suspect him of inventing such ‘codices'
whenever it suited his purpose23 but as regards Tacitus there seems to
be no reason to question his good saith ³. As to the Agricola, he
certainly possessed the MS. of Pomponius Laetus ⁴, which though
hardly ‘ vetus,' was about one hundred years old at that date, and the
greater part of his citations might certainly have been taken from its
body or margin ; yet even in these he hardly seems to cite from it ³,
and there are certainly about four places in which he cites from some
source wholly outside our present MS. knowledge ⁶. But in these
and in all other places we have no means of knowing what his source
really was, nor whether, supposing that he is quoting MSS. unknown
to us, he is quoting from his own knowledge or from secondhand and
perhaps inaccurate information‚ nor have the citations generally such
intrinsic value as to make them in themselves of any great im·-
portance ⁷.
