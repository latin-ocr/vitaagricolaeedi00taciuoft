nave prima.. This has been generally
taken to mean ‘in the first ship that
crossed,' i.e. as soon as navigation was
practicable, in the early spring. The
order of the words is (in the absence os
any special ground of emphasis) against
taking ‘ prima' adjectively (cp. ‘primis
navibus,' Bell. Al. 15, 3), and it might
more possibly be accus. pl„ as Mr.Haver·
field (Class. Rev. ix. 310) suggests, with
the meaning that he crossed by sea as
regards the first part of his journey,
instead of going round by land. lt is
also suggested (see Gudeman) that
‘prima’ as abl. sing. might be taken
with the force of ‘ primum ’ : cp. G. 43,
6; A. 14. 10, 2, διο. It is possible that
