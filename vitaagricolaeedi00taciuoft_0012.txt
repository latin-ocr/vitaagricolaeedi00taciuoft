Among the explanatory notes of previous editors
I have been most frequently indebted to those of
G. Andresen (see above), very often also to those of
Wex (see above), and C. Peter (1876), and in various
places to those of Kritz (1874), Knaut (1889), ancl
Draeger (1 891). Among recent English editions should
be mentioned those of Church and Brodribb (1882),
R. F. Davis (1892), H. M. Stephenson (1894), and the
American edition of W. F. Allen (1885); and among
English translations, besides that of the whole of
Tacitus by Church and Brodribb, one (of the Agricola
and Germania) by Mr. R. B. Townsend (1894), and
a very terse and spirited version (of this treatise
alone) by an anonymous scholar (Kegan Paul, 1885).

On the language and style generally much help
has been derived from Draeger’s well-known treatise
(‘ Syntax und Stil des Tacitus,' 1882), and reference is
often made to the chapter on the subject in my edition
of the Annals (vol. i), where several other works will
be found cited.

Among separate works closely bearing on the
subject-matter, those used in two chief sections of
the Introduction are specified in their places 2. In the
more strictly biographical part I have found much use
in two essays by Urlichs 3, and have to acknowledge
much information on military matters from two mono-

graphs by Hubner and Urlichs 4, also from Konrad
