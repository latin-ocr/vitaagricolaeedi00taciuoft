alluded to in c. 42, 5 (see Introd.
p. 10), possibly also the general dislike
of a picture of exalted virtue: cp. A. 4.
33, 6, also‘ quasi aliena virtus ex-
probratio delictorum omnium sit' (Sen.
de Vit. Beat 19, 2).

1. vetere, διε. It' is worth while to
notice this example of the growth of a
new aristocracy under the early empire.
The family is Gallie on both sides, and
in the first generation mentioned is re-
presented by procurators of equestrian
rank. The son of one and son· —-in law
of the other becomes a Roman senator
(cp. A. 3. 55, 4) under Tiberius3 and
his son, born and educated in Gaul,
marries a Roman lady of high family,
and appears so far to profit by Nero' s
antipathy to the old Roman nobility as
in the later years of that prince to pass
through the usual ‘ cursus honorum' to
the praetorship at the earliest legal age.
Becoming also an instance of Vespasian's
tendency to promote provincial citizens,
he is enrolled by that prince among the
patrician an‘stocracy (c. 9, 1), and, be-
sides being appointed to one of the
most distinguished praetorian, as after
his consulship to one of the foremost
consular provinces, becomes also a
member of the college of pontifis (e.
9, 7)-

Foroiuliensium, Frejus, ‘Octavano-
rum colonia, quae Pacensis appellatur
et Classica ’ (Plin. N. H. 3. 4, 5, 35),
owing its foundation to Julius Caesar
(Marquardh Staatsv. i. 264), and its

probably Augustus and Tiberius.

freedmen; but it is plain that the
greater procuratorships are referred to,
carrying with them the government of
lesser Caesarian provinces, or a position
answering to that of a senatorial quaestor
in greater ones (see c. 9, 5, and note);
and that such (even if sometimes held
by freedmen) were considered titles
of equestrian nobility is shown by their
being recorded on inscriptions of knights,
as were magistracies on those of a
senator. See A. Vol. i. Introd. p. 1033

senatorii ordinis. Urlichs thinks,
from an allusion to his ‘ ludi’ in Sen.
de Ben. 2. 21, 5, that he reached the
praetorship. The cognomen belongs
also to the Pomponii (see A. 13. 32, 3, ,
and note). This brachylogical genit.
of quality is common in Tacitus (cp.
‘rarae castitatis' below; c. 9, 1, &c. )and
found also in Caes. and Livy: seeA. i.
Introd. p. 52, §34; Dr. S. u. S. §72.

4. studio, διο. He is called‘ vir
egregius’ in Sen. l. 1. and Ep. 29, 6, and
besides being an orator and philosopher,
is mentioned' 1n Col. 1. 1, 14, as author
of a treatise ‘ de vineis,' ‘ facete et erudite
composita} from which a passage is
cited.

namque, explaining the opportunity
taken to gratify an old spite. Seneca
rhetorically says of him (de Ben. 2. 21,
5), ‘quem C. Caesar occidit ob hoc
unum, quod melior vir esset quam esse
quemquam tyranno expedit.’ Possibly
