romb-nt, predicated of ships in
A. 2. 6, 2, as ‘pati' of the sea in H. 5.
6, 5. Here the swordsmen rather than
the πνοι-(12 are thought of, or the latter
are very holdly personified.

1. miseere ictus, ‘ plant blow upon
blow? analogous to ‘miscere manus '
(A. 2. 15, 3), ‘vulnera miscent ' (Verg.
Aen. 12, 720), and other metaphors in
Dr. S. u. S. ς 248 h. Cp. ‘denserent
ictus,’ Δ. 2. 14, 4.

2. fodere. This emendationis gener-
ally accepted: ‘foedare' would be
eomewhat out of place by the side of
plainwords like ‘ miscere ictus,' ‘ ferire,'
the einum of H. 3. 77, 3 (‘ verberibus
foedatus') is not lel, and ‘fodere‘

ᾖ ’ is a regular word for stabbing (A. 2. 21,

1³ Η. 1. 79, 7; 4. 29, 4, &c.). Even in
a Roman soldier the face was the most
vulnerable part, and most barbarians
had uo helmets. See A. 2. 14, 4, and
adsumant. ‘Adsisto’ has osten the
military sense of taking position: cp.
H. 3. 82, 3; A. 2. 17, 4; 19, 4, ὅτε.
“ eti-inere: αμα. 18, 3.
· 3. conisae: cp. ‘studio laetitiaque
· conix& H. 4 53, 3. The ablatives are
best taken as modal.
4. proximos quosque. W'olffiin
notes (Philol. xxvi. 150) that in such

’ , superlative consti-actions Tacitus in his

later writings keeps to the singular (cp.
H. 1.55, 1ς A·13;¹52 5;15. 15, 6), but

aemineoea, a poetiealawbssdffh’lsffnin
Egra-tinctione victoriae, ‘ through

the eagemess of victory’: cp. ‘ festina-
tione consectandi: H. 3. 25, 2.

interim, &c. The text in Γ is stopped
so as to show the construction to be
‘ equitum turmae fugere, convinnarii
. . . miscuere'3 the ‘ equites ’ being thus
Britons and the ‘ hostes· below the
Romans. But no British horse appear
to be present (see on c. 35, 3), and
‘ turmae,' rarely used of other than
Roman cavalry, apparently here refers to
those on the wings (c. 35, 2), who must
no doubt have repelled the chariots
before the infantry could close. To
treat ‘ fugere covinnarii ’ as a gloss is to
leave the disappearance of this sorce
from the battle wholly unexplained,
and to make the words an abrupt paren-
thesis would be very awkward‚ and
would seem to require ‘ fugerant ' ;
whence the supposition that ‘ ut ’ or
‘ enim ’ has dropped out has very gener-
ally commended itse1f3 and it is possible
to suppose, with Urlichs, that the latter
word has been misplaced three lines
below.

7. recentem ten-orem. The same
phrase in A. 14. 2 3, 1 (cp. Liv. 36. 9, 13)
seems to mean the terror struck by recent
victory, such as would be here their
repulse of the chariots. Dr. takes it to
mean ‘ sudden,’ Peter the terror of a new
force appearing on the scene.

8. haerebant, ‘thadff-{ssjffiffssd'3 x,
so with abl. in A. 1. 65, 4 (w ere see
note), and in Livy (see W.) : the enemy
did not give way as they expected.
