quae marmore aut aere finguntur, sed, ut vultus hominum, ita
simulacra vultus imbecilla ac mortalia sunt, forma mentis
aeterna, quam tenere et exprimere non' per alienam materiam

4 et artem, sed tuis ipse moribus possis.

quidquid ex Agricola

amavimus, quidquid mirati sumus, manet mansurumque est ·

1 in animis hominurn, in aeternitate temporum, fama rerum3

nam multos veterum velut inglorios et ignobilis oblivio obruit ε
Agricola posteritati narratus et traditus superstes erit.

2. imbecillia Δ.

5. admirati Wolfflin.

6. in fama Halm, [sama

rerum] Ritt„ traditus fama rerum Peerlk., multos fama rerum notos velut Bahrens.

7. obruet: text Haupt.

” with ‘amplexus' in c. 28, 1 ι cp. Gude-

man on Dial. 5, 15.

non quia, &c., ‘ not that 1 would sor·
bid’; the metaphor is from the tribu-
nician veto. For the combination ‘ quia
. . . sed’ cp. Gudeman on Dial. 9, 133
Heraeus on H. 1.15‚ 12.

Α 2. foma mentis, cp. ‘forma animi ‘
above. Here it seems taken almost in
a Platonic sense.

3. quam tenere, &c., ‘ which yon
can preserve and reproduce not by the
material and artistic skill of another,
bnt only in your own character! Cp.
the sentiment of Seneca in A. 15. 62, 1.

4. ex, ⁴ belonging to.'

5. mansurumque est,‘andisdestined
to abide‚’ a sti-onger expression than
‘ manebit': cp. A. 4. 38, 2, &c.; Gude-
man on Dial. 9, 22.

6. in animia, &c., ‘in the hearts os
men, in the endless course os ages, by the

lory os noble deeds.’ ‘Fama rerum '
ξι. this senae in H. 4. 39, 3 (⁴ claros
retunsama’),and Liv. 25. 38,8 (¹ vivunt

‘ history‚’ though the fact that his same
will be on record is implied. As the
words stand, there is certainly some
incongruity in the clauses,which Halm‘s
reading ‘in fama ’ does not remove.
Hence the suggestion to treat ‘ fama
rerum ‘ as a gloss, or to transpose it to
another place; but see next note. .

7. nam, &c. This seems to relate
closely to ‘ fama rerum’ ε ‘ the glory of
the achievements of many has not sur-
vived, but his will last.'

obruit. This tense seems required to
suit ‘ veterum ’ ; for he does not seem to
mean that many of the heroes os old will

be sorgotten, but that they are already ⁷

so, whereas the fame of Agricola's
achievements will survive by being
placed on record. The sentiment re·
sembles that of Hor. Od. 4. 9, 25-28.
The reference need not be taken to be to
this book only; but the fact has been
that, but sor a brief and mostly in-
accurate mention in two places in
Dio (39. 50, 4; 66. 20, 1), Agricola's
name would have been unknown to us
without it.
