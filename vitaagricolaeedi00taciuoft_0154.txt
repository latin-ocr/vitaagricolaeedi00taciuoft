fremituque et clamoribus dissonis. iamque agmina et armorum

coercitum militem accendendum adhuc ratus, ita disseruit:

1. statim ulcisci, ‘to aven ge here
and now.' A. notes that though the
penalties are in the future, the insult
that contemplates them is viewed as
existing already.

in hoc campo est, ‘is for this field
to decide.’ The same idea is elsewhere
put in other words, ‘illos esse campos‚’
&c. (253. 24, 1), ‘ hac acie parari ' (A.
2. 1 , .

pssoinde, hortatory, ‘accordingly'3
so with imperative in H. 4. 74, 6.

2. maiores vestros, &c., i. e. think
of the freedom which you inherited
from the one and ought to hand on to
the other.

3. Excepere. cp. ‘varie excepta
oratio? H. 4. 59, 1. With this reading,
‘ut moris ’goes grammatically with this
word only, but in sense also with
‘.alacres’

moris: cp. c. 39, 1; 42, 5,&c. This
quasi partitive or qualitative genitive is
classical, but is used by Tacitus also in
the plural (A. 1. 80, 2) and in other
words (A. i. Introd. p. 52, ξ 35).

4. dissonis, ‘ confused' (cp. H. 1. 32,
1 ; 4. 29, 2), to Roman ears inarticulate.

agmina, &c., ‘these were bodies in
movement, and flashes of arms as the
boldest darted before the ranks’ .the
verb is supplied from the sense (cp.
c. 22, 3). The rare plural ‘ful’gores
is used of separate flashes of lightning
in Cic. and Sen.: ‘audens' (usually in a
good sense)' is perhaps in no earlier prose,
the superlative probably here only.

7. adhue, ‘still further' : cp. c. 29, 4.

ita disseruit. Cp. the words used
in introducing the former speech (c. 29,
4). Whether Tacitus had any know-

ledge of what Agricola actually said or
not, it seems clear that this speech also
is essentially his composition, and its
calmness and determination are put in
studied rhetorical contrast to the over-
strained language of the other. Eussner
notes some apparent reminiscenoes of
the speech of Scipio, perhaps also of that
of Hannibal before Ticinum (Liv. 21.
40-44) : see on c. 34. 1, 3. The topioe
here are: Britain has been discovered
and subdued; you have always longed
for battle, and it is before you with
victory or death as alternatives, · victory,
to which you have been accustomed, is
easy and will end all your hardships.

8. septimus. Themanuscriptcopy ists
may easily have confused VII and VIII
in their exemplar, and the correction is
required by the chronology. Against
the supposition that a year has been
lost must be set the fact that the sixth
year (c.25,1) is referred to below as

‘proximus ’.(c 34,1); and the previous
years are accounted sor. W.' s sugges-
tion that the original MS. had‘ xm:
and that the time gos Cerialis and F ron
tinus is reckoned m, is sufficiently refuted
by Nipp. (Rh. Mus. xix. 106-108). ”

virtute, &c. 1t· 1s possible to explain
the manuscript text by taking (with
Peter)‘ imperii Romani' as equivalent,
not to‘ populi R.‚’ but to‘ imperatoris’
(or perhaps a substitute for it due to the
writer’s aversion to any recognition of

Domitian)‚‘ fide atque opera nostrass to .

express the general' s share (‘ my loyalty
and zeal’ )‚ and ‘vicistisf that of the
soldiers. But, though quite correct to
mention the‘ auspicia '(cp. A. 2. 41, 1),
it is somewhat strange to speak of the
