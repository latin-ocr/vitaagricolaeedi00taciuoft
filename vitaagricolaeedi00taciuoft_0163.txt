whence Biihrens would here put ⁶ prout
cuique ingenium' after ‘trucidare’ But
those words here make better sense as
they stand.

α. prout cuique ingenium, ‘ as
each was inclined ’ (to fl or face death) :
⁸ hostium ’ depends bot on ⁸ catervae '
aud ‘quidam, which are contrasted, as
are also ‘armatorum ’ and ‘inermes'
Sallust has ⁴ pro cuiusque ingenio‚' ‘ pro
ingenio quisque‚’ ‘ uti cuiusque in-
ssfflim’ Gug- 49» 43 57, 4³ 93, 7)-

3. tex-3⁸ praesta-enim εἰρ. for ‘dare,’
⁴ praebere:

ruere ‘ charge'; the sense of ‘ contra ’
(c. 34, 2) is here implied.

5. anquando, &c.‚ from Verg. Aen.
2, 367. These are distinguished from
those who fied or flung away their
lives.

6. appropinquaverunt : the subject
(the Romans) is remote, whence Knaut
thinks that ‘nostri ’ must be inserted.

· idem. A subject has been implied‚

’ but not expressed in the previous words,

‘aliquando victis,’ &c.; otherwise per-
haps ‘ identidem‚’ ‘re atedly’ (cp. A.
2-79’5ἶ ¹¹·31233 .2.46,4;78‚§),
is gsomewhat nearer to the manuscript
7. gnari. This correction is sup-

ed by H. 2. 13, 1; 85, 4; 5. 6. 8.

. acitus seems to have had in mind Liv.
¹ 32. 31, ,ι (‘ cum a frequentibus palantes,
ab locorum guaris ignari circumveni-

rentur ’)‚ but here ‘incautos’ and·
‘collecti' are not so opposed as to
riquire another antithesis to balance
t em.

quod ni: cp. c. 26, 3.

8. frequens, ‘ always present ' ς so
used with local ablative in A. 4. 3, 5 ;
ep. H. 4. 69, 4. A. compares ‘ multus
in agmine‚’ c. 20, 2. ·

9. indaginis modo (cp. A. 13. 42,
7, and note), a comparison so used of
surrounding fugitives in Liv. 7. 37, 14,
of an ambush in Caes. B. G. 8. 18, 1.
Peter compares the Greek σαγηνεύειν
(Hdt. 6. 31, 3). The cavalry forming
part of this cordon are dismounted in
the thicker‚ and mounted in the thinner
parts of the forest.

10. persultare. ‘Persultari' and ‘ per-
lustrari' have been desended; but to
supply from the passive an active verb
with the previous clauses is very awk-
ward, and unless a verb has been lost
above, some change is needed. ‘ Per-
sultare‘ and ‘perlustrare' are both
Tacitean words, and the former seems
here preferable as following the indica-
tion of the best MS. ‘ Perscrutari ' is
more remote, and, though a classical
word, is not known in Tacitus. We
need not suppose a zeugma, as ‘ per-
sultare ’ has the general sense of ‘ per-
vagari’ in A. 12. 40, 2, &c.

11. vulnus, so used metaphorically
