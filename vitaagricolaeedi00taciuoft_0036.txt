‘ fama et rumore,’ ‘castris et armis ’ (c. 33, 3), ‘terrarum ac naturae'
· (c. 33, 6), ‘fictum ac compositum' (c. 40, 2), ‘celebritate et frequentia’
(c. 40, 3), ‘vulgus et populus' (c. 43, 1), ‘intervalla ac spiramenta’
(c. 44, 5), ‘formam ac figuram’ (c. 46, 3). Of the rhetorical or
poetical expansion of an idea by hendiadys the genuine instances seem
few ¹, but we may note ‘ sinu indulgentiaque ' (c. 4, 2), ‘legationibus
et foederibus' (c. 29, 3), ‘ diem consensumque' (c. 3ο, 1), perhaps
‘honore iudicioque’ (c. 43, 4), and the suggested reading ‘tenor et
silentium' (c. 6, 4). As in the Germania, and still more in the

‘Dialogus,' there are frequent instances of rhetorical anaphora, or '4

emphatic repetition of an adjective, pronoun, adverb, δια, as that of
‘ procul ' (c. 9, 5), ‘aeque’ (c. 15, 2), ‘ nihil ’ (c. 15, 3), ‘ qui’ (c. 18, 5),
‘simul ' (c. 25, 1), ‘quotidie ' (c. 31, 2), ‘ noctu' (c. 40, 5), ‘absens'
(c. 41, 1). Frequently rhetorical point is given by alliteration, as in
‘magna fama . . . mala’ (c. 5, 4), ‘deposcendis . . . detrectandis'
(c. 11, 4), ‘ paena . . . paenitentia' (c. 19, 3), ‘offendere . . . odisse’
(c. 22, 5), ‘vota virtusque,' ‘ victoribus . . . victis ’ (c. 33, 4 ; cp. c. 18, 7),
‘ mucrones ac manus' (c. 36, 1), ‘virtutibus . . . vitiis’ (c. 41, 4),
‘ famam fatumque' (c. 42, 4), ‘inglorios et ignobilis oblivio obruit'
(c. 46, 6). Also the rhetorical structure of clauses known as chiasmus
is seen here and there (e. 18, 73 20, 2; 25, 3; 28, 2; 36, 1), and
some of the personifications, as those of ‘ ira ’ and ‘victoria' (c. 16, 1),
‘pugnae’ (c. 30, 3), ‘ gladii' (c. 36, 1), are unusually bold.

In these characteristics Tacitus is somewhat in contrast with his
after self, as also in the less prominence of many of his favourite
modes of compression. The cases of zeugma, so frequent in the
Annals‚ are here few ², and some of his noteworthy ellipses or concise
constructions are rare or absent ³; and where ‘breviloquentia’ is
studied it is apt to be in a sornewhat different form. In the later
