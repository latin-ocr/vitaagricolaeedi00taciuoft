166 CORNELII TACITI AGRICOLAE

cumque divisimus, nos innocenti sanguine Senecio perfudit.
Nero tamen subtraxit oculos suos iussitque scelera, non spec· 2
tavit: praecipua sub Domitiano miseriarum pars erat videre
et aspici, curn suspiria nostra subscriberentur, cum denotandis

5 tot hominum palloribus sufficeret saevus ille vultus et rubor,
quo se contra pudorem muniebat.

Tu vero felix, Agricola, non vitae tantum claritate, seda
etiam opportunitate mortis. ut perhibent qui interfuerunt
novissimis sermonibus tuis, constans et libens fatum excepisti, ’

10 tamquam pro virili portione innocentiam principi donares.

‘ commentarii principum' (H. 4. 40, 6).
His intimate friend Pliny speaks of his
relegation (3. 11, 3), and of his high
character (4. 22, 3), and addresses some
letters to him. On Arulenus Rusticus
see c. 2, 1, and note.

2. tamen, i. e. cruel though he was,
yet, &c. ‘Subtrahere oculos,’ ‘aures'
occur again in A. 3. 53, 1 ; 16. 26, 1 ;
and a somewhat different turn, ‘sub-
trahere oculis acerba funera ’ in A. 13.
17, 4: for ‘iubere seelera' cp. H. 1. 45,
4. Nero was not present at the trial of
Thrasea and Soranus (A. 16. 27, 2).

3. videre et aspici, ‘to see him
and be seen by him’ ; so ‘viderent
modo et aspicerentur,' A. 3. 45, 2.

4. subscriberentur, ‘were noted
down,’ to be laid to our charge: cp.

subscribere quaedam animadvertisset,'
Suet. Aug. 27; also Id. Cal. 29; Quint.
1 2. 8, 8. The word is often used of sign-
ing an accusation (cp. A. 1. 74, 1, and
note), and some would so take it here.
Persons were aecused ‘ ob lacrimas '
under Tiberius (A. 6. 10, 1).

denotandis . . . sufficeret: for
‘ sufficere’ with gerundive dat. ep. A.
3. 72, 4, and note. For the use of
‘ denotare ' cp. ‘ denotantibus vobis ora
ac metum' (A. 3. 53, ι), ‘notat et
designat oculis ad caedem’ (Cic. cat.
1. 1, 2 .

5. tgt hominum palloribus. This
abstract plural (cp. Lucr. 4, 336) is
used rhetorically for ‘so many pale
saees,’ and the expression. as Miiller
notes, is condensed for ‘ ad incutiendos
pallores qui denotarentur! A glance

6. aquo:

from his fiery countenance made men ¹

turn pale, and the accusers marked it
and remembered it. W's emendation
has not been followed. With it, he
would take ‘ denotandis ’ to mean (like
Ovid‘s ‘rubor ora notavit ⁹) ‘ making
them conspicuous?

rubor. Domitian’s naturally flushed
countenance was ascribed in his youth
(H. 4. 40, 1), and by some persons
afterwards (Suet. Dom. 18). to modesty.
Pliny (Pan. 48) speaks like Tacitus;
‘superbia in fronte, ira in oculis, fe-
mineus pallor in corpore, in ore in-
pudentia multo rubore suffusa!

fatum, often used of natural, in con-
trast to violent death (cp. A. 2. 42, 5;
71, 2 : 6. 10, 3, &c.), though in c. 42,
4, with an opposite meaning. Here it
makes against the suspicion of poison,
and A. thinks it may have been the
term used by Agricola himself for his
illness. On the use of fatalist ex-
pressions by Tacitus see A. i. Introd.
