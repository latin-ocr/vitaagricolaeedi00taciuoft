position he at once accepted, and his self- effacement, if less heroic than ’
resistance, had its moral dlgnity mm be rsemembered also that ᾖ,
he had given hostages to fortune, and if he himself might sometimes
feel his lot intolerable‚ the welfare of his wife and daughter was 3 >
counsel of perseverance. In these years of his life only two acts are «j

The question of the votes which he may have had from time to time „
to give raises more difficulties. A Roman senator could neither resign
his position, nor (except in old age or illness) safely absent himself ², ⁴>
nor let the motion pass in silence, but must be in his place and dis·

thus put to Agricola we know nothing ²³, save that he died before the v
worst time3 but we know that even such men as the gentle Nerva ,¹
must have owed their safety to acquiescence in thosQthch ’ξἶ

Many an upright member of the Privy Council or of either House of Ξ
Parliament under such a monarch as Henry VIII, many others in all
times and countries have had such terrible alternatives placed before
them. There are cases, as all feel, in which death should come before
dishonour3 but we cannot draw a hard and fast line, and history has
taught us often to palliate‚ if not to justify.

Even his last years may thus be shown to have an interest for uS, i}
