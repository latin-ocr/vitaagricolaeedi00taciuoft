Tacitus gives no estimate of the sjzesogssgigajn, only speaking of it

as the lffiffigQSLlEle,RPPWUJQ-ssss'msssss ². As to its form, he modifies ·

in the light of recent knowledge the statements of Livy and Rusticus,
which do not appear to have materially differed from those who made
the island triangular ⁸. His criticism of these, and probably of all
other previous'views‚ amounts briefly to this, that they are true only
‘ citra Caledoniam,’ that the lines of coast crofnvessging-ssqustffiQ-nt

existence of an isthmus, and-‘the forffsof the tract beyond it, must be
taken as resting on the evidence *of Agricola, whose view, if stated
more in detail, might perhaps have been found to have originated the
misconception of Ptolemy as to the eastward projection of the northern
coast ⁴.

Another new geographical fact, no doubt first noted by Agricola, is
the §retractans-the„ friths οξ ‚north Britain, of the sea ‘ penetrating and
working round the land, and forcing its way between hills and moun-
tains as if still in its own domain⁶.' In most other points Tacitus

² His estimate (5. 13, 14) makes the
circumference 2‚000 Roman miles. Such
computations could only rest on the
reckoning of a ship’s daily average sail,
a mode of calculation which makes a
very large variation intelligib1e‚ and
Caesar's estimate very nearly correct, as
the distance from salient point to point
alone is reckoned.
