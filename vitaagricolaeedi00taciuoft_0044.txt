All this may be true, and may yet carry us but a small way towards ’
determining the ethnology of the Silurians of Tacitus. Of the neo· Ι

a short and dark-featured type in so many parts of the United
Kingdom makes against rather than for its identity with an isolated
race in South Wales. And as to any further evidence of the identity
of Basque or Iberian with Silurian, we have no known Iberian customs
and no Easque words traceable in Britain. Philology knows nothing
of any distinct Silurian language 3 the name of the people appears to
convey no known linguistic meaning, while their town names in
Ptolemy and the Itinerary are altogether Celtic ⁵, arguing that, what-
ever their origin, they had adopted a Celtic tongue in Roman timae.
The resemblance noted by Tacitus becomes thus our only evidence.
The attempt to identify the Caledonians opens up still more difficult
questions and far greater differences of opinion. The very general
opinion, that the tall, brachycephalic race of the round barrows are
the earliest Celts⁰‚ has suggested that these Caledonians may be

¹ See Boyd Dzzwkins, p. 330; Elton,
9²13} W. Scott has exemplified the
two types in the Highlands, in describing
the two sons of the MacGregor (Rob
Roy, ch. 31), the one ‘ taller by a head,
and much handsomer, with light blue
eyes and a profusion of sair hair‚' the
other with ‘ dark hair and dark features
and a form strong and well set.’

³ Elton (p. 141) instances several
districts in the eastern sen country, and
in the south-western counties of Com-
wall and Devon, with parts of Glouces-
tershire, Wilts, and Somerset; also
districts in the Midland counties, round
Derby, Stamford, Leicester, and Lough-
boroffithdn (p. 134) notes that the anato-
mists have concluded that the neolithic

Britons were not unlike the modern
Eskimo, short and slight, with mnscles
too much developed for their slender
and ill-nurtured bones.

⁶ Ptolemy (2. 3, 24) gives them only
one town, called Βούλλωον, a name
closely akin to several found in Gaul, as
Bulliacos (Bouilly, dep. Mame), and
personal names, as Bauius, διας see
Alfred Holder, Alt-Celtischer Spmch-
schatz. In the Itinerary they have their
Isca and Venta, the Roman stations of
Caerleon and Caerwent. The former
was no doubt known also to Ptolemy,
πὺξ confuses another Isca (Exeter)
wit it.

⁶ See Boyd Dawkins, ch. x. The
construction of the great megalithic
temples is assigned by him to the
bronze, by some to the neolithic race-
