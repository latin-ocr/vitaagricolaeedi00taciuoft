1. divus Iulius, perhaps used sar-
castically, like ‘ille inter numina
dicatus’ (A. 1. 59, 7), but more
probably only as a distinctive title, as
a Roman would use it.

modo, ‘if only': cp. A. 2. 14, 6;
¹3· 557 4⁷ &c.' ·

2. aemularentur, answermg vto
‘aemulemur‘ in oratio recta. The
exhortation is carried on in ‘ neve,' &c-

unius aut alterius, ‘ one or perhaps
two': cp. c. 12, 2; 40, 4; also A. 3.
34, 8, and note.

3. plus impet-us, διε. Most editors,
except W. and Ritt„ assume a lacuna,
on the ground that ‘impetus' ' and ‘ con-
stantia' were hardly likely to be found
in the same persons; and that their
{tpsssszzizissssdtls ssissffissgfflssstslrlssfflss
surpassed in the former. Of the pro-
posed insertions, those beginning wsth
the same letter as ⁴ impetus’ are palaeo-
graphically not improbable; but the
Romans would rather be credited with
‘scientia’ or ‘disciplina’ than ‘im-
petus' (usually rather a barbaric quality),
and ‘integris' (⁶ a hitherto unvanquished
tribe': cp. c. 31, 5) brings in a new
contrast hitherto unsuggested. The
comparison implied in ‘ plus’ and
‘ maiorem’ can hardly be other than
with the Romans, but on the whole it
seems as if the sentence, though perhaps
logically more complete with an in-
sertion, is rhetorically weakened by it,
and that the most appropriate words
to such an occasion would be those of
unqualified encouragement, that their
desperation would give both more

resolution to their resistance than could ’

be expected from the enemy.

6.‘fuerit, equivalent to ‘suit’ in ·

oratio recta ; ‘we ourselves (con—
trast to ‘ deos ') have already taken the
most difficult step in that we have inet
to deliberate ' ε to have dated this is to
dare all (‘ nam qui deliberant de-
sciverunt‚' H. 2. 77, 6), aud to have
{vercome the difficulty of disunion
c. 12, 2).

7. porro, ‘ besides,’ or rather perh'aps ⁶

=‘ atqui ' (cp. Gudeman on Dial.
5, 7), either expanding a thought or
adding another tending to the same
conclusion (cp. c. 31, 43 A. 3. 34, 85
12. 5, 5, δια).

deprehendi, i. e. to* walt unt'il you-¹
are found out: the same sentiment is
expressed in H. 1. 21, 53 81. 1.

9. His atque talibus. Nipperdey,
on A. 1. 5, 1, cites some twenty in-
stances of this formula in Tacitus-

in vicem. A. notes that Tacitususes
both this (Dial. 31, 2) aud ‘inter se'
(H. 3. 17, 3, &c.) with passives; mutual
patients being also mutual agents. For
other uses cp. c. 6, 13 24, 1; 37, 5.
The phrase ‘ his vocibus instincti ’ (cp.
A. 2. 46, 3, διε.) is found in Liv. 9.
4ol’Bbudieea. This form of a name
very variously read in MSS. (see note
on A. 14. 31, 3) is generally adopted
from the Med. text of A. 14. 37, 5, and
is explained to mean ‘Victorina ' (Rhys,
Celtic Britain, p. 282). The popular
form ‘Boadicea’ is a mere error of
some printed editions, and has uo Celtic
