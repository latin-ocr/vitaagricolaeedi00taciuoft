1. intendit. The simple inf. with
this verb (cp. A. 11. 32, 4; H. 2. 12,
53 22, 53 and Sall. and Liv.) is analo-
gous to many others : cp. A. i. Introd.

P· 54, ἓ 43- · ι
2. ut in subitis, ‘ as m hastrly formed

⁴ plans'; i.e. the want of ships was an

instance of the usual want of means in
such cases ‘ Dubia consilia' would
rather mean wavering or uncertain plans.

ratio et· constantia, ‘ the resource
and decision?

3. auxiliarium, probably his Bata-
vians (cp. c. 36, Ι), who were generally
famed swimmers (H. 4. 12, 33 A. 2. 8, 3).

4. -quibus noto. vada. This ma be
taken (with A.) to mean not that hey
knew this channel, but that they knew
generally how to find fords and pick
their way. Some have thought from
these words that Briton auxiliaries must
be meant, but he does not seem to have
used these till later (c. 29, 2).

5. seque et. In this combination of
conjunctions‚ or ‘ que . . . ac,’ used fre-
quently by Tacitus (cp. A. 1. 4, 1, and
note), aster Sall. and Liv.‚ ‘ que' is
almost always joined to ‘ se‚' ‘sibi,' or
‘ipsi'z cp. Dr. S. u. S. ξ 123.

6. qui mare. No emendations of
this have found much acceptance‚ and
the expression may perhaps be defended
by its rhetorical form, and as a mere
amplification for emphasis, and another
way of saying ‘Romanos classe, navi-

bus, mari adventuros.' They were

looking out for the collection os a fleet, .,
the advauce of ships, an attack byses ³
(with all its difficulties and delays) and -“
were amazed to find the enemy already ·

upon them.
7. invictum, ‘ invincible ’ ; so iu A,

  
 

2. 25,5; 15. 21,4, oftenin Sallust, Livy, '*

subj. with ‘ ut,' frequent in Hist. and ⁸
Ann., is used only here and in c. 20, 3,· ··

in the minor works, and only here

joined with ‘ita ¹ : cp. Dr. S. u. S. 5 182. „⁸
The consequence is referred back to the *T

time of the cause.

8. clarus ac mag-nus haberi, from ³
Sall. Cat. 53, 1 (‘ Cato clarus atque θ’
magnus habetur ³) t cp. also Jug. 92, 1. *2-

tus uses this form here only, ‘ut qui' Ἴ·-

Peter takes the ‘ ambitus’ to have been ξ

on the part of the subjects3 but the

expression rather resembles ‘ officia. ’
