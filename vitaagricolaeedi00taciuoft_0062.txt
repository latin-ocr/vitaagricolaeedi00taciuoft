46 INTRODUCTION

achievement must have been the most remarkable in Agricola s whole ·
career, and worthy of comparison with the first Roman invasion of ,
Britain; and his biographer might well have dwelt on its perils and
successes and on his recall¹ in the full tide of victory by a jealous
tyrant, whose memory Tacitus had then no motive whatever for
sparing‚ and every motive for reproaching. ,

The passage is undoubtedly one in which any supposition involves ,
difficulties; but we seem to find less in supposing that a reconnaissance ,
in some force was made across the Firth of Clyde to Bute and g
Argyleshire ², and that after some slight progress³ Agricola saw the( ἦ
impracticability of making such a country a theatre of war, and witha {3
drew with the intention of transferring his army to the east and {i

    

penetrating Caledonia from the Forth. On such a tentative expedition ²·
a biographer would naturally say little.

Pfitzner may probably be right in arguing that the forces collected ἑ
on the coast fronting Ireland⁴ were intended, at least in part, to ’ἕ
remain there, and that the Usipi and ‘ liburnicae’ of c. 28 belonged to

them 3 also in thinking that the ‘ spes ' denoted a distant rather than

immediate purpose, and that the words used do not altogether exclude ς
the ‘formido-‘²' ; but for the latter we need not suppose the Irish to .
have been roused by recent invasion. Dalriad Scots from Antrim
may, for all that we know, have already become dangerous pirates, s
or possibly Goidels on the British side of the Channel might be ⁷
helped in a rising by brethren across the sea; and such possibilities, ’ἶ
insignificant while the main army was on the west, would operate ⁴
against wholly stripping that part of troops and ships, irrespective of 2³
such ‘hopes’ as the presence of the fugitive Irish chieftain⁶ might γ
suggest. Even if Domitian had only forbidden a prepared and >

¹ We may compare the brief but
perfectly explicit account of the recall
of Corbulo from beyond the Rhine by
Claudius (A. 11. 19—20).

² The people of western Caledonia
(Epidii, διο.) might well be no less
‘ignotae ad id tempus gentes' than the
Irish; cp. the use of ‘incognitae ad id
tempus’ of the Orkneys (c. 10, 55 cp.
above, p. 23).

³ We must not press the meaning of
such a term as ‘domuit,’ which is also
used (1. 1.) of the Orkneys.

¹ As a sentence conpled by ‘que'
usually stands in very close connexion

with that preceding it, it has been

thought that the place where these troops ’-
were collected was also in Argyleshire, ⁷

on the peninsula of Cantire, than which
no more improbable supposition could
be made. Mr. Haverfield is probably
right <Class. Rev. ix. 310) in noting that

more need not be meant than that the ·

one act was subsequent to the other.

The most likely locality is that of ³

Wigton and Galloway‚ whence is still

the shortest passage to Ireland in use, ἕ

and whence the army of william 111
crossed in 1690.
