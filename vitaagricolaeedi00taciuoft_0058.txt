faint indications of a route as we had before are wholly wanting. No
road unquestionably Roman of later date in that direction is known
to us beyond Blatum Bulgium (Birrens, near Ecclefechan ¹), nor could
even undoubted remains of Roman camps or roads be assigned to this ‘ss
particular date in the absence of inscriptions. λ

An express statement in the narrative should here be noticed‚ that

except so far as it has been noticed that some, perhaps several, of the ⁷

‘ stationes ' or other camps of support may very probably have existed
before the works connecting them ⁷, and, if taken to be prior to

Hadrian's date, might be more likely to be the work of Agricola than ἶ

of any one else known to us. It has been already shown ⁸ that, in the¹
extreme vagueness of the account given, we have no certainty that the
