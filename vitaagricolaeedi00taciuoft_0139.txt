infesta. hostibus exereitus itinera.
This text is supported by ‘infestas
hostibus vias’ (Suet. Aug. 8): cp.
‘insulas saxis. .infestas’ (A. 2. 23, 3).
The manuscript text is defended by K
and W, who take it to mean ‘the

erils of the march of an army in

ostile fashion’3 whereby ‘hostilis ¹

becomes weak and superfluous. The
alternative‘ hostili exercitu' is open to
the objection {hat a Roman writer
would hardly call such a gathering
as that of the Caledonians an ‘exer-
citus.

10. timebantur. The abbreviation
deuoting the final syllable of similar
words has been often lost in MSS.

11. adsumpta in partem virium,
‘taken up to form part of his force'
