the metaphor ‘ temperaret’ is sustained‚
and that‘ libertatem haurire’ (H. 4. 5,
43 Liv. 39. 26, 7) is a near parallel.
‘Auxit' yields no satisfactory sense and
goes ill with‘ penitus,' and a converse
ιιιαῃὲεςτίιέἑ4 error(‘ ausit’ for‘ auxit ') is

Dial. 9, 20. The simple abl. with

usually an abl. of the standard <with or
without‘ ex ’), to which case the con-
struction with ‘per' (here alone used
with it) is in many phrases equivalent

pretari aliquem’ does not seem to be
a phrase in use. We might supply

‘‚famam ' but should perhaps better
refer the verb to his habits of life, as
described. Peter compares the absolute
use of ‘intellegere ' in A. 1. 11, 5.

absone, repeated for emphasis.
Charges (perhaps grounded on his
govemment of Britain) were repeatedly
brought against him in his absence
(i. e. laid privately before the emperor),
and rejected by Domitian without sum-

of these campaigns is to be found in

investigation of evidence in Gseu’s
