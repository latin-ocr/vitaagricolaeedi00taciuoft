by Tacitus. Cicero had adopted it in
the‘ Somnium Scipionis’ : cp. also pro
Sest. 68,143.

1. et domurn. This correction ap-
pears necessary, as Tacitus could not
belong to the‘ domus’ of Agricola.

muliebribus. Cp. the sentiment
ascribed to the Germans (G. 27, 2),

to the laudatiori of friends and contem·
poraries. Cp. ‘immortali memoria . . .
retinebat beneficia’ (Nep. Att. 11. 5)
and the use of ‘ aeternus ' for ‘ lifelong’
inA..14 55, 5; 15. 63, 1.

4. suppeditet, ‘suffices’ τ cp. ‘quod
si vita suppeditet, H. 1. 1, 5. l

similitudine colamus. Either this

‘feminis lugere honestum est, viris
meminisse' ; also that of the injunction
of Seneca to his wife (A. 15. 62, 1), of
Germanicus to his friends (A. 2. 71, 5),
and of L. Marcius to his soldiers (Liv.
2 . 8, 8).

52.3voees. His spirit is represented
as still holding intercourse with them.

quaa, &c.: the removal of such vir-

tues to a higher sphere is an event for
which we must neither feel nor manifest
sorrow.

3. et immortalibus. The manuscript
text could possibly be defended (as by
Brotier) by making Tacitus speak de-

spondingly of the short-lived character
’ os any kind of laudation; but this seems
contrary to the general spirit of the
passage. The insertion of ‘ quam,’
though giving an excellent sense, is
somewhat violent; and it seems there-
fore better to treat ‘temporalibus ’ as a
corruption of ‘ et (or “ te ’') immortali—
bus.¹ It need not necessarily be sup-
posed that Tacitus is speaking arrogantly
of his own work (of which he speaks
with becoming confidence below), as

‘immortalis' may be taken <with A.) to
mean ‘lifelong,' and may refer generally

or ‘aemulatu te colamus‚’ or ‘aemulatu
decoremus’ seem to be the nearest ap-
proaches to the manuscript text which
yield a good sense. As to the question
between them, the text here adopted is
supported (as B'ahrens notes, p. 168) by
‘ si natura suppeditet.' , To achieve a
resemblance to a great man's character
requires such a condition ; mere ‘ aemu-
latus’ or ‘imitatio ’ would less appro-
priately be said to do so. ‘Militum de'
is a conceivable corruption of such an
abbreviation as ‘similitude'

6. id, explained by the infinitive sol-
lowing, as in c. 39, 3.

7. revolvant, ‘ponder over', · so
(without‘ in animo’ or a prononn), in
A. 3. 18, 6; 4. 21, 2· this use appears
in Vergil and Ovi'd, but apparently in
no earlier prose than Tacitus.

8. formamque ac figuram, ‘ the type
and character‚' rhetorical synonyms, and
thus coupled in Cic. Tusc. 1. 16, 37 : de
Or. 3. 45, 179, · Plin. Pan. 55. Some
have unsuccess'fully endeavoured to de-
send the manuscript text as a hendiadys.

9. complectantur, ῑτὲῥιηεζ :2135
in memory. The idea o such a ποι·
as‘ animo’ is supplied, as that of ‘ bello ⁰
