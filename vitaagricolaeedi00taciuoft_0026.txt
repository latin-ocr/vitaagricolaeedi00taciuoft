work was composed as a whole, and on a definite plan, with the
Jugurtha and Catiline before the author’s mind ².

³ The personality of Agricola is very

prominent throughout, and the qualities
displayed by him are constantly made
conspicuous; see especially c. 18, 6-7;
1921-33 20‚2; 21. 13 22, 2-5; 24‚3;
27, 33 29, 1 ; 39, 1. Too much stress
must not be laid on this, as the same
characteristic appears in military narra-
tives in the greater works, notably in
those of the campaigns of Germanicus
and Corbulo (see Annals, Vol. i. Introd.
p. 173 Vol. ii. Introd. pp. 113, 114);
but such a purely domestic incident as
that of the death of his son (c. 29, 1)
would assuredly find no place in a
general history, as the death of his
mother and his first accession to Ves-
pasian (c. 7, 1—2), find none in the
extant part of the Histories, and his

chief interest of a whole period into
the description of a great battle, with
a prelude of speeches, is certainly
evident elsewhere (cf. Ann. 2. 12—18;

such very brief mention of the opera-

important event as the circumnavigation

so wholly outside biography as the
episode of the Usipi (c. 28), perhaps
other explanation ean be given (see note
