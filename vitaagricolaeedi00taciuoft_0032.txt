pleaders to be terse, epicrramrnatic, and striking, toleranj ogfirggdsmsfi

from the treasury of classical poeti-,y

It has also been noticed that these two treatises represent the
writer's Sallustian ², as does the ‘Dialogus' his Ciceronian period, and
that the “erga-r—n‘p—lg-Qjallust may probably have chiefly induced him to
pave the way sor a larger work by the separate publication of historical
monographs.

As regards this treatise, it has been pointed out³ that the general
plan of composition shows resemblances both to that of the Catilina ,
and Jugurtha which can hardly be accidental. All three works begin
with a preface (c. 1-3 3 Cat. 1-4 3 Jug. 1—4)‚ in which, notwithstand-
ing all differences of circumstances and subject, not a few resemblances
of tone and sentiment are observable. Then we have in each a bio-
graphical sketch of the early career of the principal person (c. 4—9 3
Cat. 5, and 15-193 Jug. 7-16); the description of Britain with which
the central part of the narrative is prefaeed has its counterpart in that
of Africa (Jug. 17—19) 3 this main narrative is broken here and there
by a digression or episode (c. 24 3 283 Cat. 38-393 Jug. 41-423
78-79)‚ and a considerable portion of it is devoted to speeches (c. 30-
343 Cat. 51—523 583 Jug. 853 1023 110) and to a full account of the
decisive battle (c. 35-38 3 Cat. 59-60 3 Jug. 101)3 the conclusion of
our treatise being the only part in which no such resemblance of plan
seems traceable. The last chapters indeed show clear traces of
another model. This work, though virtually contemporary with the
Germania, may probably have been written earlier of the two, and is
so far a connecting-link with the ‘ Dialogus ' as to present in its
epilogue a Ciceronian element ⁴ for which the Germania has no
counterpart.

A comparison of syntactical usages shows that many of those most
