144 CORNELII TACITI AGR460LAE

parrying with their swords’ (cp-¹ ob-
liquis ictibus tela deflectere’ Veg. 1.
4). K. and A. would take‘ gladiis’
and‘ caetris' as ablatives of quality,
like‘ legionariis armis’ in A. 3. 43, 2.
The weapons may be compared to the
Highland targe and claymore: for an
illustration of the ‘caetra,' or ‘cetra,’
see D. of Ant. s. v.

2. Batavorum cohortes. Unless
Α some number, answering to ‘ duas,' has
been lost, this must mean ‘ the Batavian
eohorts‚‘ i. e. those which he had in his
force. There had once been eight
attached to the Fourteenth legion in
Britain (H. 1. 59, 2), but since the
rebellion of Α. D. 69 it is not likely that
so many were together. A ‘cohors I
Batavorum’ is mentioned in a British
‘ diploma ’ ofA.D. 124 <C.1. L. vii. 1 195:
cp. also 617, &c.)‚ a ‘cohors I Tun-
grorum miliaria,' there and in earlier
diplomata of A.D. 98, 103, and 105
(Eph. Ep. iv. p. 500; C. 1. L. vii. 1193,
1194), and elsewhere, a ‘cohors II
Tungrorum’ in several inscriptions of
uncertain date (C.I. L. vii. Index,
p. 337). The Batavians lived in the
island formed by the bifurcation of the
lower Rhine (see G. 29, &c.)‚ the Tun-
gri were a German tribe settled in the
district of Tongres near Liege (G. 2, 5,
and note).

3. rem ad mucrones, &c.: cp. Liv.
2 46, 3, ‘pugna iam ad manus, iam
ad gladios . . . venerat' ; 34. 46, 10,
‘dextris. .gladiisque gerebatur res)
Here ‘ mucrones’ is used, to fix attention
on the distinction between the Roman
and the British sword.

5. inhabile, ‘awkward’: cp. ‘tegi-
men . . . inhabile,’ H. 1. 79, 6, &c.,
used of persons in A. 3. 43, 3.

parva, &c. Itis possible that both

as they do not altogether repeat each
other. The smallness of their shields
and great size of their swords were dis-
advantages, and the pointlessness of the
latter an additional disadvantage at close
quarters. 1f either part is a gloss the
first sentence is most open to suspicion,

bus gladiis’ ). On the Caledonian
weapons of later date see Introd. p. 29.
Livy speaks (22. 46, 5) of the Gaulish
swords as ‘praelongi et sine mucroni-
bus,' and contrasts them with the
Sp anish. This long iron sword, too
flexible for thrusting, and therefore
made without a point, is very different
from the short, pointed, leaf-shaped
sword of the bronze age (see Boyd-
Dawkins‚ p. 364).

some found in poetry as ‘haeret

10, 361; 11, 632), &c. In battlegene-
rally the Britons seem to have relied on

in arto. This correction seems re-
quired by sense and context, and a scribe
might easily have confonnded ‘arto’
with ‘ apto! Cp. ‘in arto pugna aptior
Romano quam Hispano ’ (Liv. 28. 33, 9),
and the description of the Germans in
A. 2. 21, 1 ‘ cum ingens multitudo artis
locis praelongas hastas non protenderet,
