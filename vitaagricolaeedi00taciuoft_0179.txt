2. mia, δυο. That this sentence
cannot be taken as punctuated in the
MSS. has been already noted. Among
other difficulties iu taking it with the
following words, is the argument that
if he was happy in escaping coming ills,
hevm not so in leaving his wife and
daughter to face them; which would
have the more force if the clause was
placed aster ‘ fama‚’ or after · amicitiis ⁷ ;
though in any case the words mean no
more than that a man is hap y in not
having outlived all who were earest to
him. As the words stand, they can
only be taken as representing a suf-
ficiently distinct idea in the writer’s
mind to have bem more naturally ex-

passed in a separate sentence, sor which,
a stroke os conciseness, an abl. abs.

is substituted. Stress is laid on ‘ beatus '
(as in e. 43, 3, ou ‘tristis ⁹), and the
meaning would be that his good fortune
i! seen both in his position and sur-
mnndings having lasted out his life,
and also in his having escaped the evil
days in store. ‘ His wife and daughter

Α curvived him, and he may seem to have

been even blest by fortune in that his
position was still massailed, his repu-
tation prospemus, his kinssolk and
stiends still preserved, and in that he
escaped the future!

(aee Dr. S. u. S. 5 173), between ‘sicuti ’

(or possibly ‘sicut ei') and ‘ita’ (as
ostener between ‘ut' and ‘ita’: cp. c.
6, 4); that as on the one hand he missed
a great happiness, so on the other he
escaped great misery. The attempt (of
Boetticher and others) to explain the
manuscript text by supposing such an
unprecedented ellipse as that of sup·
plying ‘solatium tulisset' from ‘sola-
tium tulit ‘ may be dismissed. To omit
or bracket ‘quod ’ is less simple than to
alter it to ‘ quodam ⁷ or ‘ quondam,' but
even this seems unsatisfactory. ⁴ Omina-
batur durare ' can hardly stand for
‘ ominabatur se duraturum'; and even
the latter would seem wrong. What
Agricola could be said ‘ominari' was
that Trajan would be emperor, not that
he would live to see him such. W.'s
text rests on the doubtful postulate that
Orsini is following a manuscript reading
of authority3 and such an expression as
‘ cuiusdam felicitatis' (ι happiness of
some sort ’) is hardly complimentary to
Trajan. It seems necessary to suppose
a lacuna, which may have been filled by
some such words as Dahl and Miiller
suggest, but which, in the absence of
evidence, is best lest blank.

durare, &c. The alteration to

of ‘ optabat‘ is here supplied with
‘votis' Trajan inherited considerable
fame from his father, who was a dis-
tinguished ‘legatus legionis’ in the
Jewish war (Jos. Β. J. 3. 7, 31), must
