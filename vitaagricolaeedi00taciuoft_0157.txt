1. quo modo, osten used by Tacitus
for ‘ quemadmodum,' and thus followed
by ‘sic': cp. A. 4. 35, 3 ; G. 19, 4,
and notes.

taken as a concise ab . abs-2 cp. c. 18, 7.

forth-imum, &c. If ⁶ pellebantur '
is right, the tense would show that the
remark is not general, but intended to
refer to the campaigns which they had
'gone through. Hence many would
take ‘ruere (with Spengel) as a per-
fect: Tacitus being (as Peter here
shows) very fond of such perfect forms.
But it is difficult to suppose that he
would have used it where it was so
liable to be amb‘ ous. Such a use of
the historica! in . with the imperf. as
that-in A. 3. 26, 3 (‘postquam exui . . .
et ψ . . incedebat ’) is hardly parallel,
md unless ⁸ ruebat ' or ‘ ruerat' is to be
ress- it seems likely that some words
furtim describing the action of the
holder animale may have dropped out.

4. reliquus. δια, · what is left is the

’ ¹ mass of weaklings and cowards’: cp.

Hor. Ep. 1. τι, 27 (¹ numerus sumus ).
‘So Cerialis is made to say (.H· 5. 36, 4)
ηὲῗιῗὲἳὲἓηῗὲ.» ²¹²⁰ ²²⁰¹¹¹²¹⁸’ ‘¹¹¹¹ ω’

5. quod . . . invenistis, ‘as to the
fact that you have found them.’ Such

’ a nse of ‘quod ' is noted as found here

alone in Tacitus, and in the following
words the construction is com ressed.
We should expect something li e ‘sci-
ῒιέἰο eos non restitisse! Peter cites H. 3.
3 , 1, διο, ’

non restiterunt, δια, ‘they have
not made a stand, but have been caught‚'
fight only because they can fly no
further. We have a reminiscence of
Liv. 21. 40, 6, ‘nec nunc illi quia audent
sed quia necesse est pugnaturi sunt!

6. novissimae res, ‘their extre- ν
mity’ z cp. ‘ novissimum casum ' (H. 2.
48, 4; A. 12. 33, 2), ‘novissima’ (A.
6. 50, 8), &e. The word is coupled
with ‘extremus’ in G. 24, 3. As re·
gards the following words, it is plain
that ‘ corpora' and ‘aciem ' cannot
both stand; and the best explanation
appears to be that of Prof. Gudeman,
that ‘ et ' indicates that a nominative is
coupled with ‘ novissimae res‚’ and that
⁸ aciem ' is a gloss on ⁵ corpora,' which,
as the more contemptuous term, is here
more rhetorically suitable. ⁸ Extremus
metus' would thus be an enallage for
‘extremarum rerum metus.' It is no
doubt also possible that ‘ corpora' re-
presents ‘torpor' or ‘torpore ’; also
the emendation os Urlichs, though some-
what more violent, has some support
as nearer to the possible reminiscence
of Liv. 22. 53, 6 (‘quod malum . . .
cum . . . torpidos defixisset ⁹). Cp. A.
1. 68, 2, and note, and the description
in A. 14. 30, 1.

7. in hia vestigiis, ‘ on that ground
on which you stand': cp. ‘mori in
vestigio’ (Liv. 22. 49, 4; H. 4. 60, 4),
&c.

8. ederetis, ‘ were destined to show
forth ': cp. ‘ pars . . . imperii fierent,’
G. 29, 1. The sense of ⁴ edere’ is
