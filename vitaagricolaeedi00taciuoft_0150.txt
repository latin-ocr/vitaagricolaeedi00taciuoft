are mentioned in H. 1. 70, 3. Others
are found under Titus and Domitian in
Pannonia (Henzen, 5428, 5430, &c.)‚
and elsewhere. On their employment
in Britain itself see c. 29, 2 and note.

3. ager atque annus, ‘the land and ,›

¹ its yearly produce.’ This emendation is

generally accepted : for the use of ‘an-
nus ' for ‘ annona,' probably after Lucan
3, 343, cp. ‘ expectare annum,’ G. 14, 5.
‘conteruntur' can easily have lost its
terminal stroke, and such a sense as that
of ‘ consumitur ’ can be supplied from it.
On the requisitions of corn cp. c. 19, 4,
and note.

4. emuniendis (here alone in Taci-
tus), ‘ making roads through ' : the usual
sense of the word is to fortify, and per-
haps, as A. thinks, the notion is here
that of making elevated causeways; or
the words are a concise expression for
‘ viam per silvas munire‚’ as Livy has
‘ ad rupem muniendam‚’ 21. 37, 2. The
leading grievances of subjects are all
brought together, conscription, tribute,
corn requisition, forced labour. ,

5. nata servituti; so in Cic. Prov.
cons. 5, 103 Liv. 36. 17, 5 3 here in in-
dignant contxast to the free-born Britons.
