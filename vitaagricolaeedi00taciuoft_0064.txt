known Roman invasion of those regions; and even if it is correetly ⁷

maintained that Roman encampments of apparently different dates ,

exist sometimes in the same locality ¹, we may be only comparing the :J
work of Urbicus with that of Severus, or either of them with others .
unknown to us. That the site of the great battle was not very distant ³
from Agricola's sea base, is suggested by the fleet being sent on
before to strike terror and by the march being made ‘expedito
exercitu ²,’ i.e. without heavy stores or baggage, to the camp near* ’
which they fought ⁸. Subject to this, the scene may be laid wherever ,

a background of hills and woodland rises out of the plain, and almost ’-

every antiquary has had his own favourite spot. The same obscurity '

hangs over the person of Calgacus, a mere stage-figure who comes ’ ’

forward to make a speech, and is never heard of before or after it. ⁴
Respecting the Roman forces which took part in this battle, and
in the campaigns generally, we have somewhat firmer ground to go ¹

upon ⁴ It is certain QgQQQlQQonS
of the original army of occupat10n‚ the Second (‘ Augusta ’), the mth

and the Twentieth⁵. To these it has been shown that we may 1
probably add the Second (⁶ Adiutrix ') ⁶, but we know not whether all ν

were actually taken, or if so, in what strength they were present⁷.

We are told that the Ninth was weak ⁸, and may assume that all had ν

to leave a considerable depot behind at head-quarters3 so that, even „
on the supposition that four legions were with him, his legionary force J
may probably not have exceeded some 15, 000. The auxiliary force ⁴ η
present, though it bore the whole strain of the battle, appears not to ’

have been numerous; 8, 000 soot and 3, ooo horse being placed in= ’

line⁹‚ and a further cavalry force of four‘ alae,' probably about 2,500,

being held in reserve ¹⁰. The auxiliary foot are certainly below the ⁴,

of their locality, and of the source
whence Ptolemy got the names, they
hardly help us.
¹This‚ according to R. Stuart and

others, is the case at Ardoch; but the
smaller camp there‘ 1s the only unques-
tioned one, and its apparent date later
(see note above). That the larger en-
closures are also Roman camps is more
doubtful.

⁴ This whole subject is very sully
treated by Hiibner, ‘ Das Romische Heer
in Britannien,⁸ Hermes xvi (1880, pp.

514-584, and Urlichs, ‘Die Sehlacht am

'¹ None are named m these campaigns “i

excep t the Ninth. Urlichs (p 5) argues
that phis three columns (c. 25, 4) cou ld
only have contained one legion each, as

the yNinth, the weakest, had no other

with it, but this is not conclusive; see
