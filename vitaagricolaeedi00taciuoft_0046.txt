30 INTRODUCTION

and perhaps non-Aryan, which has succeeded in overpowering 'itu
neighbours. The locality and description make it probable that one
or both of the peoples are identical with the Picts of later date ¹3 but
· such an identification would only substitute one difficulty for another,
and amount to saying that the Pict riddle must be solved² before the
Caledonian 1s attempted.

We seem thus forced to conclude that the ethnology of the Silurians· ‘⁴ ,

of Tacitus' is doubtful, and that of his Caledonians altogether unknown· ‚
but that non-Celtic, or even non-Aryan elements of population may
have existed not only in isolated localities, but intermingled elsewhere
with later immigrants, is not only probable in itself‚ but has been
most ably argued from the examination of ancient superstitious,
customs, or solklore, seeming to date back to other than a Celtic
origin ³.

Neither Caesar nor Tacitus mention any other Celts in Britain than
the Gauls; but we cannot suppose that those passing by this name
were the only or the earliest Celtic immigrants. If, as seems generally
thought, the first Celts were the introducers of bronze, and were the
tall race of the round barrows ⁴, their arrival in Britain may be dated
back ‘to the thirteenth or even fifteenth century 13.c. ⁵, but we have no
clear evidence as to their previous home or successive waves of move-
ment. The great linguistic fact, that the Celtic speech of these islands

falls into two broadly distinct families, Goidelic and Brythonic ⁸, each Ἰ

represented by still existing languages ⁷, finds no recognition, and
answers to no distinction in Tacitus or any other Roman author; and

savage appears from the fact that Celtic
art survived here (as also in Ireland)
when extinguished in the south by the
Roman conquest (A. J. Evans, Sixth
Rhind Lecture).

¹ Picts begin to be heard of, as allied
with the Scots from Ireland, in the

have treated of this large subject, which
cannot here be entered into.

⁴ This is not to be assumed as un·
questioned.

⁵ Sir J. Evans, ‘ Aneient Bronze Im·
plements of Great Britain,' thinks the
introduction of bronze may be carried

middle of the fourth century. One of
their subdivisions has the name Dicale-
dones ; fifty years earlier, Eumenius had
spoken of ‘ Caledonum aliorumque Pic-
torum silvas et paludes.'

² It has been generally held that the
word ‘ Pict ’ is Latin, and that the
people are Celtic, but Prof. Rhys argues
(Rhind Lectures‚ 1889) that the name
is native, and the people and language
non-Aryan.

⁸ See Elton, ch. viii. Many writers

back to that date.

⁶ These are osten distinguished as ‘q’
and ‘p' Celts, the latter letter being
used by Brythons where the former is
used by Goidels.

⁷ The former is represented by Irish,
Gaelic‚ and Manx; the latterby Welsh,
Breton, and Comish (extinet as a spoken
language, but preserved by literature).
For their probable area of diffusion
during the Roman occupatiori, see the
map in Rhys, ‘ Celtic Britain!
