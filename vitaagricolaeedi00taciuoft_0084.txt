6. optimae: text P.

‘ impeditum’ (‘uphill and full of ob-
stacles'). Cp. c. 33, 4; H. 3. 56,
, &c.

4 1. celeberrimus = ‘clarissimus'
chiefly a poetical and post Augustan
sense3 so of authors in H. 3. 51, 1 ; A.
¹4· 19. The sense is as if he had
written ‘ita scribere pronum erat, nam
celeberrimus quisque,‘ διο.

2. sine gratia aut, ambitione,
‘without partiality οι· sels secking ' (C.
and R). An author might salsify his-
tory to please friends or to gain some
object. Cp. the contrast in A. 6. 46, 4,
‘non perinde curae gratia praesentium
quam in posteros ambitio.’

bonae . . . eonscientiae, ‘ eonscious-
ness of well—doing,’ ie. of having fulfilled
the historian’s duty ‘ne virtutes sile·
antur' (A. 3. 65, 1). Such expressions
as ‘bona’ or ‘mala conscientia‚' in
which the adjective has the force of an
objective genitive, approach nearly to
the modern ‘ conscience ' : cp. Sen. Ep.
43, 5, ‘ bona conscientia turbam ad-
vocat, mala etiam in solitudine anxia
atque sollicita est.' For‘ pretium’ in
the (originally poetical) sense of‘ prae-
mium, '..,3cp0126 G.‚242; H..1

3. ae pleriqueff nay, many': cp.
c.,;362 H..,;2624 3.58„4&c. ln
the following words two sentences are
combined, (1) that they wrote their
own lives, (2) that theyy did not eon-
sider it arrogance, but honourable self-
confidence to do so. They felt that
they had a just claim on the appre-
ciation of their hearers.

5. Rutilio, P. Rutilius Rufus, cos.
649, Β. C. 105, an orator and a Stoic,
highly praised by Cicero (de Or. 1. 53,
229, &c.) and Velleius (2. 13, 2). He
was condemned (as it is said unjustly)

for extortion in Asia about Β. c. 93 or
92, and lived in exile· at Zmyrna (A. 4.
often extolled by Seneca.

Scauro, M. Aemilius Scaurus, cos.
639, 647, Β. c. 115, 107, censor 645,
Β. c. 109, and many years ‘princeps
senatus‚’ a great leader of the aristo-
cracy, but an enemy os Rutilius (see Α.

3. 66, 2, and note), and described in .

very opposite terms by Cicero and by
Sallust (Jug. 15, 45. His autobiography
is mentioned by Cic. (Brut. 29, 112) as
valuable, but no longer read. It is
however cited in Val. Max. 4. 4, 11,
and mentioned in Plin. N. H. 33. 1, 6,
21.

eitra. fidem, ‘ beneath credibility.'
This prep. is used in a sense nearly
equivalent to ‘ sine ⁹ by Quint„ Plin.1na ‚
&c., and by Tacitus in his minor works
only (ep. c. 35, 2 ς G. 16, 3, and Gade-
man on Dial. 27, 10).

aut obtrectationi, ‘or matter of ’

censure,' as contrary to good taste.

adeo, &c., ‘ so truly does. the age
most fruitful in excellence also best
appreciate it': cp. the sentiment in
H. 3. 51, 3, and ‘sim lex admirandis
virtutibus antiquitas’ Sen. Cous. ad
Helv. 19, 5).

7. nuno, ‘in these times ’ τ cp. Dial.
29, 1 : 35, 1. Peter rightly notes that it
is not taken here in the narrow sense os
0. 3, 1, but of the present age generally
as opposed to the past, and especially
of Domitian’ s time.

narraturo, &c., ‘even when about

to relate the life of a dead man ⁹(one

removed from the envy and jealousy of ⁸

the present: cp. A. 4. 35, 2), in eontrast
to the examp les of men who wrote
their own lines, and published them in
their lifetime.

His fortitude in adversity is ’
