The emperor could debar a senator from drawing his ‘lot⁸; but in
such a case as Agricola’s Domitian would desire to avoid so strong '

a measure and yet to prevent what was unacceptable. o the enc

peril, to promise their good offices to extricate him, and the farce is ’
gone through of a humble req-uest answered by a gracious permission -,

 

to decline the office, without, as we are told, the customary offer of the
salary ¹². We know no more of him during these last eight years but
that he lived on, not in affluent circumstances ⁶, unharmed, if not

unmenaced. As to his part as a senator in the state trials of the time ⁶, ξ
the silence of his biographer is perhaps discreet, but there must have,

been few who could cast a stone at him, nor can we assume that all
condemned were innocent.

When the end came, it found him deprived of the society of his

daughter and son-in-law ⁷, but watched over by his beloved wife⁸ and ⁷·

by a circle of friends, not to speak of the marked interest taken‘in his

illness by strangers outside his intimacy, and even by the gossip of*

idlers all over the city, nor was the news of his death received lightly
or soon forgotten ⁹. That among such people a charge of slow
poisoning by order of the emperor should arise and win‘ credit is what
we might expect; nor, unless Domitian is much misjudged, can we
suppose the· charge incredible; but we have the candid admission of
Tacitus that no evidence existed beyond the fact that he had taken
extraordinary pains to keep himself informed of the progress of the
