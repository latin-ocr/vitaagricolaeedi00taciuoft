directions, the one going north-west to Luguvallium (Carlisle), the
other nearly due north, crossing Hadrian’s Wall near Corstopitum
(Corbridge) and going on to Habitancum (Risingham) and Bremenium
(High Rochester), whence there appears to have been an extension to
Cramond on the Firth of Forth ¹. Whether any part of this road
existed in Agricola's time we know not, but in the absence of any
evidence either way we should incline to suppose some such line as

   

taken by him. Some points should however be noticed which may

give weight to a different supposition.

If there is any force in the suggestion ² that the advance of Roman ἶ
dominion by Cerialis took place in the east and north-east of the -r

’ Brigantian territory, we should be led to suppose that Agricola had to

subdue the western part of Yorkshire‚ Westmorland, and Cumberland. s
Also the fact that his campaign of the previous year had been in ἶ
North Wales³ lends colour to the supposition that an army destined .

for an advance next spring might have wintered at Chester‚ and taken
that rather than York as its starting-point. 1t is also noticed that

‘ aestuaria⁴' are prominently mentioned among the difficulties of this ’

year's march, which would be wholly absent from an inland route such
as either of the roads above mentioned, and by no means a feature of
an advance along the eastern coast ⁶, but would be most characteristic
of the coasts of Lancashire and Cumberland. Nor, if we reject the
reading ‘Taum' in c. 22, 1, have we anything clearly pointing to
any locality on the east ⁸ till his quarters are fixed on the Bodotria in

western side in Λα). 82, when he was collecting troops on the coast
sacing Ireland ⁸. This of itself proves nothing, as he could easily have
led them across from the Forth by the newly constructed lines ⁹, but it
may have some weight when taken in connexion with the other con-
siderations. A reason for preferring a circuitous coast-line to a shorter
inland route may also be found in the desirability of drawing support
