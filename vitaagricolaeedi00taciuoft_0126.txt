1. quantum liceBat, i. e. as far as
a subject could become great under an
emperor: so Memmius Regulus is called
‘in quantum praeumbrante imperatoris
fastigio datur, clarus' (A. 14. 47, 1).

Liv. ²4· 26, 13; and the accus. with

more loosely with ‘virtutem.' Syrn-

media . . aestate, i. e. about July.
The question whether this was in A.D.
77 or 78 involves the difference of a
year in dating all his campaigns and
his recall, which latter would thus fall
either in 84 or 85. Those who support
the earlier date consider that he must
have started immediately (‘statim,’ c.
9, 7) after his consulship, which they
would therefore place in the second
three months of 77. But ‘ statim‚' ean
have another reference (see note there),
and there is nothing else to show at
what time of the year he was consul;
nor does the ‘nuper‘ of c. 39, 2 (where
see note) show that he was recalled in
843 and a strong argument against the
earlier date is surnished by the episode

be placed in 82, a year too soon (see
c. 28, 1, and note). I have therefore taken
his arrival to have been in ΑΔ). 78. It
has been suggested as possible that his
departure was delayed by the formalities
of his election to the pontificante (c. 9, 7).

occupied most of central and north

Silures under the rule of Caratacus
