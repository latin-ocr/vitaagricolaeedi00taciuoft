CORNELII TA CITI AGRICOLAE

stris ei pugnae facies erat, curn †egra ‹liiss‘aut stante simul
equorum corporibus impellerentur3 ac saepe vagi currus,
exterriti sine rectoribus equi, ut quemque formido tulerat,
transversos aut obvios incursabant.

37. Et Britanni, qui adhuc pugnae expertes summa collium
insederant et paucitatem nostrorum vacui spernebant, degredi
paulatim et circumire terga vincentium coeperant, ni id ipsum
veritus Agricola quattuor equitum alas, ad subita belli re-
tentas, venientibus opposuisset, quantoque ferocius adcucurre-

10 rant, tanto acrius pulsos in fugam disiecisset.

Britannorum in ipsos versum, transvectaeque praecepto ducis
a fronte pugnantium alae aversam hostium aciem invasere.
tum vero patentibus locis grande et atrox spectaculum: sequi,

1. in gradu stantes R„ aegre diu (iam diu W) stantes Brotier, instantes, ad-
stantes, ante stantes al.; aegre clivo instantes Schoemann, Halm, e gradu aut

statu Eussner, e gradu aut stantes . . . simul Ritt.

by treating ‘ enim ³ as either misplaced
(see note above), or as having arisen
from dittography of ‘ei,' or as a cor-
ruption of ‘iam‚’ will make the words
down to ‘erat' intelligible, but that
beyond that no satisfactory restoration
is possible. For ‘pugnae facies' cp.
H. 2. 42, 4, &c.; also c. 38, 2. Tacitus
may have had before his eyes the descrip-
tion of a conflict of cavalry ‘minime
equestris more pugnae' at Cannae
(Liv. 22. 47, 1), and of another ‘ non ut
equestri proelio solet ’ in Sall. Jug. 59, 3,
and may have meant here to describe
horsemen as having to force their way
through a solid mass. The cormpt
words probably also represent some
mention of the difficulty of forcing their
way uphill against the vantage ground
of the enemy; but we cannot tell
whether the Romans or Britons are the
subject of ‘ impellerentur.’

3. exterriti, &c., taken from Sall.
H. 1. 96 D, 98 K, 104 G, ‘Equi sine
rectoribus exterriti aut saucii conster-
nantur.‘

4. transversos aut obvios, ‘ in flank
or front.' Here again we cannot tell
who are spoken of; but the next words
seem to show that, though the Romans
are called ‘ vincentes‚’ their progress was

5. expertis Γ. 6. digredi

difficult, and that the British reserve
was thereby induced to advance.

5. Britanni, those in the rear (c.
³⁵²6.³){a0u1 ει otiosi: and explained by
(or, as some think, a gloss on) ‘ pugnae
expertes’: in H. 4, 17, 7, opposed to
‘ occupati.' Some take it to mean
‘securi' (cp. Med. A. 2. 46, 1), which
seems hardly snitable to their position.

7. vincentium, ‘the vieton'ous
side'; so A. 1. 63, 33 H. 4. 78, 4.

coeperant, i. e. they had began to
do so and would have done so; rhetoric-
ally putting what would have happened
as if it had happened. See c. 13, 4,
and note.

8. subita. beni, ‘emergencies' ς so
in Liv.6. 32, 53 25. 15, 20:111 H. 5.
13, 5, the sense is different.

10. eonsilium, that of attacking in
rear; explained by the conjunction in
the next sentence.

12. aversam, on the opposite side
(H. 2. 51, ²3 3. 84, 4; A. 1. 66, 2);
i. e. in the rear.

13. tum vero, &c. The description,
evidently imitated from Sall. Jug. 101,
