his designation as emperor. ‘ Fortuna '

leader of the original expedition, who ⁸

remained in Britain A.D. 43-47‚ and
received an ovation (A. 13. 32, 3), an
honour usually reserved, like the full
triumph, for the imperial family (see
note on c. 40, 1). His achievements,
after the capture of Camulodunum,
are not recorded: see A. ii. Introd.
p. 132, foll. He had been coS. in 782,
