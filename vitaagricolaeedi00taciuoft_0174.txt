CORNELII TA CITI AGRICOLAE

Domitiani vero natura praeceps in iram, et quo obscurior,
eo inrevocabffior, moderatione tamen prudentiaque Agricolae
leniebatur, quia non contumacia neque inani iactatione liber-

tatis famam fatumque provocabat.

rei publicae usum, ambitiosa morte inclaruerunt.

odisse quem laeseris. In this senti-
ment h⁸e seems to have followed Seneca,
who says, ‘pertinaciores nos facit ini-
quitas irae’ (de Ira, 3. 29, 2), and
⁴ magna fortuna insolentes quos laeserunt,
et oderunt’ (Id. 2. 33, 1). In A. 1. 33, 2,
we have ‘odia quorum causae acriores
quia iniquae! A sense of our own base-
ness leads to hatred of a person who
suggests the thought of it.

1. vero, pointing the contrast: Do-
mitian would seel this sar more than
other men. ‘ Praeceps ’ is so used with
‘in’ in H. 1. 24, 23 with ‘ad' in A. 16.

2. inrevocabilior, a rare word,
originally poetieal but in prose from
Livy, here alone used by Tacitus, who
has elsewhere ‘ implacabilis)

3. leniebatur. It is to be noticed
that, though Agricola himself received
no further distinction during these years,
his son-in-law was praetor in Α. Ι). 88,
and then or earlier ‘ quindecimvir sacris
faciundis‚' and probably received a pro·

closely joined in idea, the one being
regarded as the sure precursor of the
other (cp. c. 41, 4, and note), and the
connexion being strengthened by the
alliteration, that it is hardly necessary
to supply such a sense as that of ‘ quae—

and may be regarded as one of the
brachylogical harshnesses of the style
of this treatise (see Introd. p. 21). If

sed. There seems to be an implied
antithesis, as if he had said. ‘ er ipsis
periculosa sed reipublicae inuti ia ’ (cp.
A. 14. 12, 2). A., who adopts ‘enisi,’
