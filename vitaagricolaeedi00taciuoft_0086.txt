wards accused by Metius Carus ‘quod
de vita Helvidii libros composuisset'

Rusticus. The book was preserved by
Fannia, wife of Helvidius (Plin. l. 1.)

Thrasea, banished when the latter was
putto death (A. 16. 33, 3), restored and
made praetor in 823, ΑΛ), 70 (H. 4. 4,
5; 53, 3), and prominent at that time
in the senate, banished again and after-—
wards put to death by Vespasian (Suet.
vesp. 15). On his son see c. 45, 1.

Usually‚when a word intervenes between
⁴ non' (or ‘nee') and ‘ modo‚' the latter
is joined by ‘et ' or ‘que ' to another
word: see Gudeman on Dial. 2, 6.

3. saevitum, sc. ‘essel This fact
would also be recorded in the ‘ acta.'

triumviris, se. ‘capitalibus.‘ On
these officers see Mommsen, Staatsrecht‚
ii. 594, foll. and note on A. 5. 9, 3. The
duty would appear from A. 4. 35, 5, to
have belonged to the aediles, and its
delegation to lower officers who super-
intended executions seems a mark of
insult. The actual functionaries who
burnt such books appear from Liv. 40.
29, 14, to be the ‘victimarii.’

used ofwritings in A.4. 61, 1; 15. 41, 2.

4. in comitio ac foro. The ‘co-
mitium' was the part of the space of
the Forum adjoining the ‘Curia’ and
‘ Rostra' (see Middleton, i. 237. 242,
&c.), and was the ancient place of trials
and punishments (Liv. 9. 9, 2, 8ιο. ; Plin.
Ep. 4. 11, 10), and for such condemna-
tion of books (Liv. 40. 29, 14). The
addition ‘ ac foro ’ is probably only one
of thg combinations of synonyms so

5. vocem om. Δ.

common in this treatise (see Introd.
p. 19): cp. ‘ficus arbor in foro i o ac
comitio Romae nata' (Plin. N. . 15.

18, 20, 77). That the twowords respec- ’ ..

tively imply ‘ignominiose ac pnblice'
(Wex) seems too fine a distinction (see
Wolfflin, Phil. xxvi. 137); but such
public ignominy is conveyed by the ex-
pression as a whole.

5. conscientiam, here‘the sympathy ῃ

of the human race,’ their consciousness
of the honour due to such men. The
same idea is expressed (evidently with
tacit allusion to Domitian) in A. 4. 35,
6, by ‘praesenti potentia credunt ex·
tingui posse etiam sequentis aevi memo-
riam’; where, however, he is rather
referring to the reservation of such
books in spite of t ese precautions.

6. arbitrabantur. The subject (Do- γ

mitian and his advisers) is supplied
from the sense.

expulsis, —aoristic abl. aba, adding
another fact: cp. c. 14, 3, 43 22, 1 ὅ 23,
2, &c. An expulsion of philosopher-s
by Domitian, attested by several writers,
is connected by Suet. (Dom. 10) and

Dio (67. 13, 3) with the execution of “

Arulenus Rusticus (see above), and is
stated by Pliny (Ep. 3. 11. 2) to have
taken place in his praetorship‚ which is
placed in Α. 1). 93. The statement in
Eus. Chron. (see Introd. pp. 58, n. 11;
59, n. 1) that Domitian twice thus acted,
perhaps arises from confusion with a
previous action by Vespasian-

7- atque, &c., a repetition in sub-
stance of the previous sentence: cp.
Wolfflin in Phil. xxvi. 139, who notes
that Tacitus, following Sall. (Cat. 10, 43

Jug. 1, 3), uses ‘bonae artes' of high ¹.

moral qualities, ‘malae’ of their op-
posites (H. 1. 10, 3), and ‘artes civiles,’
