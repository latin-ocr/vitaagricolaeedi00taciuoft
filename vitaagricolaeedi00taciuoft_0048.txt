would point to much the same date ¹. The‘new-comers appear to ²
have occupied the most important half of the island, within (and in

 

some places beyond) the line of the Trent‚ Warwickshire Avon,

Parret, and Stour²; and they may probably have originated the

general name Britanni and Britannia ³. The country occupied by 9

them was densely peopled‚ and stocked with abundant flocks and

herds ⁴. It is probable that we also owe to them the beginning-⁰. of '³

systematic husbandry ⁶, and the turning to fuller account of the ὲ

capacities of the soil for corn-growing ⁶. The invaders may have ι
mingled to some extent with the previous inhabitants, and may have -

been partially unaffected by Subsequent changes in Gaul itself, from⁴ ²³.
which causes may have arisen such differences as were observable ’
between Gaul and Briton. Hence we have languages similar but not ’

identical⁷, some distinct customs, such as the use of woad⁸, and

perhaps some differences of physical appearance ⁹.

¹ Isolated specimens of iron imple-
ments from the bed of the Thames and
Shannon have been referred to as early
a date as the seventh century B.c.
(A. J. Evam, Second Rhind Lecture);
but the general substitution of iron for
bronze is dated by Sir J. Evans in the
second or third century R.C.; c . also
Boyd Dawkins, c. xii. In Caesar s time
those on the coast had local iron (B. G.
5. 12, 4), and must therefore have been
able to smelt it 3 but it was sufficiently
precious to pass by weight as money:
their bronze was wholly imported (Caes.
l'¹²'3iz11ys‚ ‘Lectures on Welsh Phiio-
logy‚’ p. 185. Their area would mainly
coincide with that of the coinage; see
below, p. 33, n. 7.

³ On the history and various forms of
the name see Rhys, ‘ Celtic Britain,’ ch. 6
A Belgic tribe, ‘ Britanni,’ was still
surviving in Pliny’s time (4. 17, 31, 106),
and their name is thought to be pre·
served in that of a village, Bretagne, at
the mouth of the Somme (Holder). The
older name Albion is still retained by
Greeks, and survived in the Scottish
Alban.

mals, especially the Celtic shorthom
cattle, had existed in Britain from neo—
lithic times (Boyd Dawkins, p. 297, &c.).

bronze, and even in the neolithie period

(see Boyd Dawkins, pp. 268, 340), but
seems so far exceptional that Caesar
had the report (5. 14, 2), ‘interiores pleri·
que frumenta non serunt, sed lacte et
carne vivunt pellibusque sunt vestiti ’ (in
contrast to Gallie clothing). Tacitus
implies (c. 30, 3), and Dio at a later
time assera, that the Caledoniam had
no husbandry (76. 12, 1).

⁶ ‘ Solum . . . patiens frugum, fecun-
dum’ (c. 12, 5).

⁷ ‘ Sermo haud multum diversus’
(c. 10, 4). Elsewhere he speaks of a

another language as ‘resembling British '
(G. 45, 2); statements implying a dis-
tinction.

⁸ Caesar would hardly have called
the practice universal (5. 14, 3) if he
had not noticed it in the Gauiish Britons
with whom he fought, and who would
thus seem to have adopted it. Some
similar custom is spoken of as occasional
by Pliny (22. 1, 2, 2), though unnoticed
by Tacitus3 and something of the kind
is made by Herodian (3. 14) character· ”
istic of the Caledonians, as it was (if the
Isiatifr} derivation of the word is right) of
t e icts.

⁹ Caesar (5. 14, 3) speaks only of
their flowing hair and long moustache,
but otherwise shaven face ς Strabo, who
had seen a few casual specimens (4. 5,
2, 200), says they were taller than Celts
