The chief study however that has been made in
preparing this edition has been that of works bearing
on Britain, its people, and its conquest. The amount
of literature on this subject is very large, and, though
in great part lying outside the scope of an edition of
this treatise, embraces much that bears more or less
upon it.

In what little had to be said on prehistoric times,
I have used Prof. Boyd Dawkins’ ‘Early man in
Britain' (1880), Sir C. Elton’s ‘Origins of English
History’ (1882), also Sir J. Evans’ works on the
Coinage of the ancient Britons (1864, and Supplement
1890), and on the Stone and Bronze periods (1872,
and 1881), and some researches on Celtic art by
Mr. A. J. Evans ¹. On the Celtic people, and the
meanings of Celtic names, I have consulted the ‘Celtic
Britain' (second ed„ 1884) and other works2 of Prof.
Mys, and the ‘Alt-Celtischer Sprachschatz 3' of Alfred
Holder. I have also received some kind communica-
tions from Prof. Kuno Meyer, of Liverpool.

The works relating to the Roman period are far

scattered in antiquarian periodicals. It is much to be
regretted that no comprehensive work on Roman
Britain as a whole has appeared in modern times in
which the results of all these researches could be
