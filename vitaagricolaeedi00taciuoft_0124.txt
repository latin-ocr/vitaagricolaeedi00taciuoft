standing. To supply‘ essent’ would
be certainly to go beyond the general
limits within which Tacitus uses this
ellipse (see A. i. Introd. p. 53, ξ 39 h),
and must be justified, if at all, by the
not fully parallel instances, A. 1. 7, r ;
H. 1. 85, 5. The alteration of ‘et' to
‘esset’ or ‘essent' seems clearly the
best emendation, if any is needed. The
alternative suggested by the marginal
MS. text, though possible, may be only
a conjecture; and it does not seem a
great stretch to give ‘pactus sum ’here
the deponent construction which the
participle has elsewhere (H. 4. 60, 3,
&c.). For a full discussion of the diffi-
culties see Nipp.‚ Rh. Mus. xix. 105,
f011.; Wfflfflin, Philol. xxvi. 98.

1. et seditio sine sanguine stetit,
‘and the mutiny came to a standstill
without bloodshedx The omission of
this sentence would give the description
a weak and abrupt ending; and the
sense of ‘stetit’ seems sufficiently jus-
tified by A. 12. 22, 3; Η. 4. 67, 3, &c.;
also Plin. Ep. 5. 11, 3(‘ nescit. .libe-
ralitas stare ³.) Nothing is here said
os the flight of Trebellius (see note
above

2. {Tettius Bolanus: see c. 8, 1,
and note.

3. agitavit Britanniam disciplina,

‘harassed Britain by keeping his army
in training! It 1s very difficult to sup-
pose this text sound; but no emendation
has found favour. The following words
help to explain it.

4. nisi quod, ‘except that ' (cp. c. 6,

1): i.e. he was not, like Trebellius,
‘per avaritiam ac sordes contemptus'
H. 1. 60, 1

( et 11111118); see above, §4 The abl.
here seems causal.

7. recuperavit (on the form cp. c. 5,
4, and note), a somewhat exaggerated
expression. Paulinus could rightly be
said to have ‘ recovered ' a virtually lost

province (c. 5, 4), and Cerialis had dione ⁸
ere ⁸

the same in Lower Germany3
Vesp asian could only be said to have
re· esptablished a full y authoritative govern-
ment. Suet. says (Vesp. 1)· incertum

minuta, se. ‘ est ’: ep. A. 15. 39, 2.
The asyndetic addition of a clause oon-
taining so different an idea to those
preceding is noted by Gndeman as
contrary to the usage of Tacitus else-
where. cp. c. 13, 5; G. 30, 23 441
&c. Hence he suggests that the‘ et’
before ‘terrorem' should be placed
besore‘ minuta)

govemed Britain probably from the
spring of A. n. 71 to that of ΑΛ). 74.

Brigantum. This name, taken by
Rhys to mean ‘ freemen,’ is probably
that of a confederacy including several
subordinate tribes, and extended over
the whole country north of the Trent
