tania here and in some other places Δ.

aerius, taken as an adverb defined
by the following words; the correction
‘ultraque ¹ rests on the probable sup·
position that ‘q;' dropped out before
’ἢῆ the asyndeton is generally re-
tained, but is certainly harsh.

1. concessum. The old Roman
antipathy to philosophy, noticed apolo-
getically by Cicero (⁴ vereor ne quibus-
dam bonis viris philosophiae nomen sit
invisum,’ Off. 2. 1, 2), still survived (see
Friedlaender iii. 616), and rested on
its drawing rnen away from active life :
cp. ‘ ut nomine magnifico segne otium
velaret’ (H. 4. 5, 2). Soon after Agri-
cola's youth, Stoicism, as the creed of
Thrasea and his political partisans,
became especially obnoxious to Nero,
whose advisers represented it to him as
actively mischievous (A. 14. 57, 5);
a charge combated by Seneca (Ep. 7 3, 1).
See A. ii. Introd. p. 83, foll. ‘ Senatori '
may possibly be used, by 'anticipatiom

of an aspirant to that rank ; and some Λ. castrorum rudimenta, ‘appren· =

such word (perhaps ‘ senatorio ’) seems
appropriately to emphasize ‘ Romano.'

hausisse, ‘ would have imbibed‚'
osten used in similar figures : cp. c. 40,
43 H. Ι. 51, 6; 4. 5, 4, and Gudeman
on Dial. 28, 28. In ‘ oratio recta ’ ⁴ hau-
riebat ' would probably have been used
(cp. ‘ agitasse: c. 13, 4) ; the indicative
in this tense having constantly the force
of a subjunctive to denote what was on
the point of happening, but for some
hindrance: cp. A. i. Introd. p. 57, 5 5o;
Dr. S. u. S. ς 194; Roby‚ 1574.

3. sublime et erectum, διο. S
nonyms are again accumulated: ‘his
lofty and elevated mind was craving the
beauty and splendour (or perhaps, hen—
diadys, ‘ the beautiful ideal' z cp.

‘ species eloquentiae,’ Cic. Or. 5, 18) of
great and sublime glory ’ (that of a lise
spent in contemplation of the noblest
ideas). The second word generally
strengthens the first.

4. vehementius quam caute, ‘ with
more ardour than cantion!
expect ‘ quam cautius' (cp. c. 44, 2, &c.);
but the manuscript text has ‘ acrius quam
considerate ² in H. 1. 83, 3. It is perhaps
analagous to other uses of positive for
comparative in Tacitus (as A. 2. 5, 2;

4. 61, 1, &c.)‚ and possibly here, as ,

W. thinks, a more declsive negation is
implied. For the cantion required see
note above on ‘ concessum.’

5. ratio, ‘ discretiori ’ : cp. c. 6, 4.

We should ⁴

6. modum, probably best taken in the ψ 13

sense of μεσότητα, ⁴ balance,’ a tempera-
ment preventing him from being carried
into extremes of thought or action.

of which office, or that o'f ‘praefectus

Augustus as a qualification for admis-
sion to the quaestorship and senate

Suetonio Paulino. This famous
officer (cp. c. 14—16) is well known both
in the Annals (14. 29—39) and Histories
(1. 87, 3, &c.)‚ and had previously won
distinction in Mauretania in 794-795,
Α. D. 4¹-4²› and was probably cos.
suff. in the latter year: see note on A.
14. 29, 2. His memoirs are noted in
