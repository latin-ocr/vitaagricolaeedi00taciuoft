CORNELII TACITI AGRICOLAE

nostram usque ripam mutatione ementium adductos indicium ⁴

tanti casus inlustravit.

29. Initio aestatis Agricola domestico vulnere ictus: anno i

ante natum filium amisit.

rorem muliebriter tulit: et in luctu bellum inter remedia erat. ξ

igitur praemissa classe, quae pluribus locis praedata magnum i
et incertum terrorem faceret, expedito exercitu, cui ex Bri· 1

tannis fortissimos et longa pace exploratos addiderat, ad

ιο montem Graupium pervenit, quem iam hostis insederat.

10. Graupiiim Γ, Graupium A, Graupius mons marg. index of Γ, Grampinm P.

and later edd.

‘veno dare.’ The verb is not in Cicero,
but in Sallust and Livy.

1. nostram, the left or Gallie bank
of the Rhine. Those taken by the
Frisii would certainly be beyond it.

indicium . . inlustravit, ‘their
story of this great adventure gained
them fame' (cp. H. 3. 62, 4; Dial. 23,
5; 37, 6). The indic. after‘ sunt qui‚'
common m poetry (Hor. Od. 1. 1, 2 ,&c.)
but very rare in prose, seems used here
because only a definite few are meant

= ‘nonnullos ’). See Gudeman on
Dial. 31, 22 (the only other instance
in Tacitus).

3. Initio aestatis. It is clear that this
is not the summer of c. 28, 1, but the
following one (cp. c. 34,1). It is
difficult to suppose ‘sequentis' to be
supplied from the sense, and Brotier's
suggestion that‘ vii 'has been 'lost after
the last syllable (‘ vit ⁹) of the preced-
ing chapter is not improbable.

ictus. This can be taken aoristically
with ‘amisit’; but it is very peculiar
that the verb would have to explain the
participle, instead of, as usual, being
explained by it. It is therefore perhaps
better to stop it thus (with K. and Dr.),
and to take it as ‘ ictus est,' making the
following words an explanatory asyn-
deton. We gather that Agricola was
accompanied by his wife here, as in
Asia (e. 6, 3).

5. fortium, ‘strong- —minded‚ ’ used
sarcastieally.

ambitiose, ‘ostentatiouslyss making
a display of ἀταραξία to gain admiration

(cp. ‘ambitiosa morte,’ c. 42, 5). ’
Tacitus is not slow to censure the vanity
of Stoies (see Introd. p. 14, n. 5), as
elsewhere their indolence (H. 4. 5, 2),
and had probably special reasons for 1
hostility to them at the date of this
work· see Introd. p. 10 foll.

the uncertainty of defendere as to the·
