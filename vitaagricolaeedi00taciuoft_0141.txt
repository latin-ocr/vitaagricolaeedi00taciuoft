uti mos, δια, applying only to

oppugnare, &c. The phrase‘ oppug-
nare castella adorti' is from Livy (35.

an ostensive movement. It ι5 ιιοι neces-
sary to sup se, with A., that forts had

ne . . . circumiretur. Lest the
combined force, or any portion os the
force, of the enemy should get round to
attack his rear, he divides his own
army, so as to cover a larger area, and
check their advance in all directions.
From the threefold division of his army,
and from the isolation of his weakest
legion, the 'Ninth‚ it has been inferred
that Agricola had only three legions,
each of which formed the nucleus of
a division. It is no doubt possible that
the ‘Secunda adiutrix' had been already
withdrawn (see Introd. p. 37), or that
a legion had to be left behind some-
where in gan-ison 3 but we cannot
assume that the three divisions were all
of equal, οι· nearly equal strength. The
various ingenious conjectures (see Skene,
p. 48, foll„ dcc.) as to the sites of these
cafflps are all without confirmatory
evi enee.

6. et ipse, ‘himself also': cp. G. 37,

9. nonam. This legion, part of the
original invading army, had been almost
cut to pieces in A. D. 61 (A. 14. 32, 6),
after which it had been reinforced (14.
38, 1), but, as some think, may have
never fully recovered its strength. A
more probable explanation of its weak-
ness is that of Urlichs (‘ Schlacht,' p. 25,
n. 4), that a ‘vexillatio' had probably
been withdrawn from it by Domitian for
