all edd„ except Ritter and Peter, have
followed L., but it seems less open to
objection to suppose that Tacitus has
here used the word in an unprecedented
sense than to invent an otherwise
altogether unknown word, ‘ devortinm.’
A. thinks the abstract ‘longinquitas’
more forcible than ‘longinquae re·
giones’: his reference to ‘spectaculorum
antiquitas' (A. 14. 20, 4) is to a doubtful
parallel. The device here alluded to

become profitable to a few, ’ by bribes
received to escape this needless trans-

supported by Ov. M. 2, 86; 13, 161.
