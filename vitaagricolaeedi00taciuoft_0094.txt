1. intercepti P and most edd.

3. reciperatae L, Halm.

8. degressus Γ,

digressus 1⁸2, Δ.

A. 1. 17, 73 35, 2) be suitable here.
This participle is found in Cic. and its
comparative in Liv. (4. 37, 9), Plin.
rna. and Quint.

in ambiguo, ‘in nncertainty' (ep.
H. 2. 45, 4, δια), its possession trem-
bling in the balance.

1. coloniae, probably a rhetorical
plural, referring only to Camulodunum
(Colchester)‚ or loosely including other
towns, not colonies (as London and
V erulam), which suffered also. The
‘ veterani’ were the colonists and
garrison. On the events see A. 14. 32.

intersepti‚ ‘ isolated': cp. H. 3. 21,
23 53, 2. ‘ Exercitus' is often used of
separate legions (cp. A. 3. 12, 63 H. 3.
15, 1, &c.); and that these were pre·
vented from combination on this
occasion is shown by the fact that
Paulinus had little more than one
legion and auxiliaries with him (A. 14.
34, 1). The form in the other places
is ‘ intersaepio,‘ which somewhat helps
the emendation ‘intercepti' here, with
the meaning ‘ cut off' or ‘ cut to pieces'
(cp. c. 28, 43 43, 2, &c.); ‘exercitus'
being in that case another rhetorical
plural for the Ninth legion (A. 14.
32, 6 .

de)sa1ute‚ &c.: cp. c. 26, 3, and note.

3. alterius. This genitive is con-
stantly used sor ‘alius’ to avoid the
ambiguity of that form: cp. c. 17, 3;
H. 2. 90, 1, &c.

summa rerum. This could be taken
to mean ‘the supremacy’ (as in H. 2.
33, 4, &e.) or ‘the general plan ’ (as in
H. 2. 81, 4; 3. 50, 4, &c.)‚ if some
such meaning as ‘devolved upon‚' or
‘ rested with,’ were supplied by zeugma
from ‘cessit in! A. would make it
mean ‘ the decisive result ’ (cp. ‘ summa

rerum expectatio,’ Caes». Β. C. 1. 21, 6),
and takes the following words as de-
fining it. Max-a takes it as ‘summa
gloria rerum et recuperatae provinciae?
For ‘cessit in’ (‘passed to ) cp. A. 1.
1, 3; H. 3. 83, 1, &e.

recuperatae (cp. c. 1¹7, 1) z this form
occurs in six places in Med. 11‚in all

ff!

Ἰ

of which Halm alters to ‘recip.’ in ἶ,
accordnnce with other places in that .

MS. and in Med. Ι.

4. artem et usum, ‘skill and ex· ’τῇ

perience ' :

cp. ‘ scientia atque usus
militum,' Caes. B. G. 2. πο, 3.

‘ Addere ,ζ

stimulos' is a known phrase (Lucan 1. ζ
263), but the verb is used also with v

:sipem3³ ‘metum,’ &c. in the sense of
are.

5. cupido. In the minor works this ’

word occurs here only, ‘ cupiditas' four
times3 the latter being rare in Hist.

and never found in Ann., and ‘cupido’ Ι 2¹
very common in both: cp. Gudeman on ξ

Dial. 2 , 8.

6. temporibus, abl. The later years 1=
of Nero are referred to, and the chief ·
instance in the writer’s mind is no doubt '

that of Corbulo.

sinistra, ‘unfavourable’: cp. ‘sini-
stra sama‚' H. 1. 51, 8, and many similar
phrases.

erga, ‘against,’ or ‘in relation to‚'
a sense common in Tacitus (A. 2. 2, 5;
76, 3; 4. 11, 3, διο.) and very rare
before him. See A. i. Introd. p. 60,
ς 59; Dr. S. u. S.§ 983 Roby, 1931,
1932.

7. ex magna . . . ex male: ‘as
much peril arose from fame as from
insamy.’ On the alliteration cp.¹ Introd.
