18 INTRODUCTION

(c. 35, 3 3 36, 3), noteworthy abstract plurals, as ‘ fulgores ' (c. 33, ι),
‘ pallores ’ (c. 45, 2), rare comparative forms, as ‘ porrectior ' (c. 35. 4),
‘ inrevocabilior’ (c. 42, 4), or superlative, as ‘ audentissimus ' (c. 33, ι),
senses new in prose ¹, or altogether neW, as of ‘ dissociabilis ’ (c. 3, 1 ; -
ἅπ. εῖρ. in prose, and in the sense here given to it), ‘ anxius' (c. 5, 2),
‘percolere' (c. 10, 1), ‘obtendi’ (c. 10, 23 also in G.)‚ ‘adfundi'
(c. 35, 2), ‘spiramenta’ (c. 44, 5), ‘transvectus ’ (c. 18, 3), or varia-
tions from usual phrases, as ‘terga praestare' (e. 37, 3), ‘ bellum
impellere’ (c. 25, 1), ‘ complexum armorum' (c. 36, 1).

Traces of study or imitation of previous authors abound in all the

writings of Tacitus; and it is apparently a characteristic of 'this

treatise to show a larger proportion of such reminiscences of prose
authors and less of poets. The Ciceronian character of the epilogue
and the traces of Sallust in the ‘ dispositio operis ' have been already
noticed: the influence of the latter author is further shown by the
interspersion‚ as in the Germania, of sententious maxims 3 the descrip-
tion of Romans put into the mouth of Calgacus recalls the letter of

Mithridates; and other sentiments in the same speech (c. 31, 1), and ³
in that of Agricola (c. 33, 4), seem modelled on the speech of Catiline

(Cat. 58), and parts of the description of the battle (c. 37, 2-3) on ·

that of the battle against Jugurtha, with detached expressions (c. 33,
4-5 ; 36, 3) from other parts of the author. Elsewhere we have from
the same source ‘clarus ac magnus haberi ’ (c. 18, 6), ‘qui mortales
initio coluerint' (c. 11, 1), ‘ pro salute, de gloria certare' (cg 26, 2;
cp. c. 5, 3), ⁴ multus in agmine,' ‘ nihil quietum pati ' (c. 20, 2), ‘oriri
sueta ’ (c. 12, 5), ‘ frustra esse ' (e. 13, 4), ‘edoctus aliquid’ (c. 26, 2),
‘ memorabile facinus ’ (c. 28, 1, also in Livy), the Graecism ‘volentibus
erat ' (c. 18, 3), the metaphorical use of ‘pronum’ (c. 1, 2 ; 33, 4).
The traceable reminiscences of Livy, fewer and less close, are
found chiefly in the narrative of the great battle. In the speech of
Agricola, some parallelism of sentiment and a few resemblances of ex-
pression are noted (c. 33, 13 34, 1, 3) to the speeches of Scipio and
Hannibal before Ticinum and to other places, and a similar influence
is traceable in the description of the advantage gained by knowledge
of locality‚ and that of drawing a ‘ cordon ' round the enemy (c. 37, 4),
also in the military senses of ‘ diducere' (c. 35, 4), ‘in vestigiis'
(c. 34, 3), ‘vestigiis insequi' (c. 26, 2), ‘vitare’ and ‘ad manus’

'rSome of the expressions noted below as taken from poets seem not found in
ear rer prose.
