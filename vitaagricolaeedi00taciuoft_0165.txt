secreti colles. If this text is sound,
we must sup that the ordinary
meaning of ‘ secluded,' which would not
be appropriate, passes here into that of
‘ solitary? The ‘ secreta domus ’ of A.
«τε aare ,em-›issazsssrssszzssessg
‘ deserti ’ is somewhat violent.

7. vires, ‘forces’ (cp. A. 12. 9, 1,

on the Orcades (c. 10, 5).

peditem atque equites. Prof.
Gudeman would alter the number οἱ
one os these, noting that Tacitus in
combining these words never elsewhere
varies the number, except in adversative
clauses (as G. 6, 2) or different syn-
tactical relations (as A. 14. 40, 4). It
seems best to retain the text, noting it
as an exceptional usage of this treatise.

these to be on or near the lines between
Clyde and F orth, and near the latter.
