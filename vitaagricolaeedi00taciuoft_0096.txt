quibus inertia pro sapientia fuit.

1. procunsulem Γ, procos Δ, text Halm, and in l. 3.
6. inter preturam quaesturam 1', Ρ, text Δ.

in l. 7. 4. faelicitate Δ.

8. quietis Δ. transit Γ, Ρ, text Δ, R.
languor, torpor al.

2. neutro = ‘ neutra re '; so ‘ nullo,' A.
3. 15, 4, where see note.

parata peccantibus (sc. ‘ esset,'

› supplied from below), ‘ made sor wrong-

doers,' by the temptations of its wealth
and works of art, and by the facility of
finding tools for iniquity. Cicero (ad
Q. F. 1. 1, 29) congratulates his brother,
who had held that proconsulship for
three years, on having abstained from
all plunder and preserved his integrity
‘in tanto imperio, tam depravatis mori-
bus, tam corruptrice provincia,' and
uses similar language elsewhere.

3. quantalibet, here alone in Tacitus:
first in Livy and Ovid.

4. facilitate. cp. c. 9, 43 here in
a bad sense, ‘connivance.'

redempturus esset, &c., ‘would be
ready to purchase a reciprocal conceal-
ment of misdeeds’ H. 4. 56, 4;
and6‘ alienae culpae dipssimulator (H.
2- 5 ‚3)·

5. auctus θείη so used of the growth
osa family iu A. 2. 84, 3; Cic. Att. 1.
2, 1. On the daughter see c. 9, 7.
It is shown that his wife accompanied
him to the province (cp. also c. 29, 1);
a custom which had been attacked (A.
3. 33-34)‚ but was not forbidden.

in subsidium, by giving him the
privileges of a parent (see note below,
and above on 5 ι).

solacium, ‘compensation’z
44 5³ H 1· 77 4 &c

6. interf the interval betweenss pro-
bably one year (Staatsr. i. 535). We
should have expected ‘annum interf
but Tacitus may have preferred a harsh

cp.c.

idem praeturae tenor et 4

2. ac Γ, et Δ, so also

9. certior: tenor R, otium Ritt, terror,

construction to repeating the word
twice. He would take precedence of
a childless man: cp. Plin. Ep. 7. 16, 2
‘simul quaestores Caesaris suimus; ille
me in tribunatu liberorum iure prae-
cessit, ego illum in praetura sum con-
secutus, cum mihi annum Caesar re-
misisset!

8. quiete et otio, modal abl. Tbese
SAygglriiliing {sege lcnhncmoiggylgiv42f‘1i,his
tribunate would fall m the year A.1>.66,
in which Arulenus Rusticus, who would
thus have been one of his eollaegues,
contemplated exereising his veto in the
trial of Thrasea (see on c.2, 1).

sub Nerone, sc. ‘existentium,’ or
equivalgnt to an attributive adjective.
c . c. 1 , 1.

Ρ9. quibus inertia, διο. In those
times Memmius Regulus was ‘ uiete
defensus‘ (A. ¹4· 47 2), and Iba
made his real indolence pass for pru·
dence (H. 1. 49, 6). Pliny speaks thus
of his own times (Ep. 8. 14, 7),

‘suspecta virtus, inertia in pretio!

praeturae. This again might be
held aster the interval of another year,
and would thus sall ln Nero’ s last year
(Α. D. 68): cp. ‘ sequens annus’ (c.

, 1).

7 tenor. This widely accepted emen-
dation is perhaps to be retained, but
under protest, as too far from the MSS„
and not known as a Tacitean word.
lt is used, with or without a genit (as

‘vitae ’) by Augustan poets and Livy3
and‘ et silentium' mi ghtbeexplanstory}
or a hendiadys, like‘ honore iudicioque’
