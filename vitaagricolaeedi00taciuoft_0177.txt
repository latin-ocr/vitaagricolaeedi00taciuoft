8. honore iudicioque, possibly a
hendiadys, but perhaps better distin-
guished by A. as act and thought (‘ the
mark of t and the esteem implied
in it'). ‘ udieium' is used specially
of savem-able opinion in A. 4. 39, 2
(where see note). He took as a com-
, pliment what had been dictated by sear

‘ter' to stand for ‘tertium' or to be a
corruption of ‘iterum,' and place his
birth in Α. D. 39 or 40, we must still
metaturae-{tas
thereading ‘primum' is open to other
obJecflons. The date here adopted of
hh birth would suit that of his quaestor-
nhip (see on c· 6, 2), and is not irrecon-

, dlnble with that of his father’s death

>nee on (3.4, 1). Also, as it is the usual

though not invariable) practice to name
, both consuls, it is robable that the
third consulship of aius, in which he
began the year as sole consul (Suet. Cal.
17), is meant. We should thus suppose

iu respect of the years of his life. In
some enses errors of chronology appear
to be due to Tacitus himself (see on A.

birth would be June 13, that os his
death Aug. ²3·

and (as also Gaius above) give their
name to the whole year, though they
were out of office at the time spoken of.
The former, Cn. (2) Pompeius Collega,
may have been son of one of the name
who was legatus of Galatia, Α. D. 75
(C. Ι. L. iii. 1. 306); the full name of
the other is unknown, and his cognomen

6. habitum, ‘personal appearance ’

7. nihil impetus. ‘nothing pas-
sionate.‘ We should gather that in
some original MS. it had not been clear
whether ‘metus ' or ‘ impetns’ was in-
tended, that the exemplar followed by
Laetus gave them as altematives‚ one in
the text, the other in the margin, and
was followed by him in this respect,
while the scribe of Δ supposed that they
were to be combined. ‘ Impetus‚’ in
the sense of ⁴ impetuosity of character '
(cp. A. 13. 54, 6; H. 1. 57, 5), on the
whole makes better sense than ‘metus,’
which, though it can mean ⁴ metuendum
aliquid' (cp. A. 1. 40, 1, and note), is
elsewhere used of circumstances, and

. chiefly takes this meaning from the

M

context, and would be here very am-

biguous.
