took the field early in 86, and may have
driven them back across the Danube
(cp. ‘Daci . . . victi,’ Eus. Chron.), but
returned to Rome by the summer,

Corne 'us Fuscus, who in the same year
was killed and his army cut to pieces
in Dacia. After this disaster, probably
the gmtest since that of Quintilius
Varus, two years passed, in the latter
of which (ΑΔ). 88) the Parthians threat-
ened war by taking up the cause of the
pseudo-Nero (H. 1. 2, 3), and the

Roman prestige by a considerable vic-
tory over the Dacians, but Domitian
,hirnselt after perhaps inflicting some
chastisement on the Chatti (see on c.
39, 2 , is stated (Dio, 67. 7, 2) to have

ed the Marcomani from Pannonia,

and to have been defeated by them.
This defeat and those of Sabinus and
Fuscus explain the allusions lssre to
hat to
Pannonia probably points to a later
date, that of the Suebo-Sarmatic war of
A. D.
invaded that province and annihilated
ι legion (Suet. 6). Domitian was at
the seat of war probably from May 92
to Jan. 93, and on his return consecrated
a laurei without claiming a triumph
(Suet. 1.1.).

ripa, here understood to be that of
