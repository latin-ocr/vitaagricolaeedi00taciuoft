1. initium, &c. Similar language is
put into the mouth of Caratacus in 12.
34, 2 ‘illam aciem . . . aut recipe-

nam et, &c. The argument
mainly dwells on the ‘necessitas‚' and
would wholly do so if ‘uni ' were to be
read ; but the text as it stands could be

lyze their action (cp. 5 3).

3. securum, ‘free from danger':
cp. Dial. 3, 33 H. 1. 1, 5: so used of
things, sor ‘tutus,’ in Livy (39. 1, 6)
and afterwards, but rarely.

sor the combatants; also the thing
hoped for ( subsidium ’) is coupled with
the hope. A. compares ‘ad coniugii
spem, consortium regni‚' A. 4. 3, 3.

7. eoque, &c. The received text
seems defensible as a flight of rhetoric,
whereby the speaker is made to say
that because they were the noblest race,
Fortune had located them in the furthest
fastness, the better to preserve them un-
defiled. They may have claimed supe-
riority as an indigenous people‚ and
may well have been believed and have
believed themselves to be such (cp. Caes.
B. G. 5. 12, 1), though Tacitus thought
them German immigrants (c. 11, 2).
‘ Situs’ is used of persons (cp. A. 12.
ιο, 2) after Sallust.

8. servientium, substantival (cp. c.

said, ‘we are not only not polluted by ί

10. recessus ipse, &e. In this much
vexed sentence, if the text is mund, ‘a 1

‘sinus' are rhetorical synonyms (op. ⁷·
‘sinus impen'i,' G. 29, 4). He would

is made to say that their glory as itweoe

Peter), makes the figure very extrava- >
gant, and to take‘ famae¹ (with Peon-l·-
kamp and others) as dative (op. ‘soleti-f*

seems to give a false meaning. Th heir ί
