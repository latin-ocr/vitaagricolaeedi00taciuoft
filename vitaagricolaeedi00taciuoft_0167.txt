(Li.) this triumph alone is noticed,
whence some, as Merivale (vii. p. 93),
think that this latter was the only
triumph, and that Tacitus was misled
into antedating it by Domitian’s assump-
tion of the title ‘ Germanicus ' (wrongly
dated in Suet. 13 as ‘post duos trium-
hos,’ i. e. in 89) in or before Α. D. 84.
ut it is unlikely that this title, and the
issue (in or before A. D. 85) os coins
inscribed ‘Germania Capta’ (Cohen i.
482, n. 135), was unaccompanied by a
triumph, of which Tacitus was probably
Qffi'wimffimffliffiffi‘tiffljissssitgf
not later than 86). 'I'hat the triumph
,was a sham (cp. G. 37, 6) is maintained
in Dio. 67. 4, 1 (μηδ’ ἑορακὼς που πόλε-
pm), and Plin. Pan. 16 (‘ mimicos
currus, falsa simuIacra victoriae ’) ς but,
without taking account of the flattery of
court poets, there is no doubt that the
frontier was substantially and per-
manently advanced: see Introd. p. 543
G. 29, 4, and note. Frontinus (who
may have served in the expedition) says
(2. 11, 7) ‘victis hostibus Germanici
nomen meruit,’ and s of his justice
to the Germans, and again (2. 3, 23)
speaks of him as directing a battle.

been ascribed to Gaius (Suet. Cal. 47),

ι. at nunc (cp. c. 1, 4). This seems

capable of depending on ‘inerat cona
scientia,' without (with K.) supposing
a zeugma. Clemm (p. 94) makes it an
instance in which an accus. and ins. in

&oratio obliqua’ is added to a sub—

stantive with a verb of thinking, feeling,
or saying implied: cp. H. 5. 20, 13 A.
6. 30, 4, &c. The adjectives are the
true predicate: ‘ the victory which was
now extolled was real and great.'·

pressed and silenced, if any other than
himself should grasp military fame.’ Cp.
‘studiis civilibus ’ (used of a juxist in
A. 3. 75, 1). This probably does not
refer to the expulsion of philosophers,
which is to be dated later (see c. 2, 2,
and note), but to the general repression
of Domitian's rule as a whole (c. 3, 2).

needed, as a new point is added in the
paramount importance of military repu-

is Domitian were surpassed in eloquence
or political gists, he need not be uneasy,
for it might not be noticed; ‘ but
eminence in good generalship was an
imperial quality3' all would think it
significant if a subject outstripped an
emperor in that.
