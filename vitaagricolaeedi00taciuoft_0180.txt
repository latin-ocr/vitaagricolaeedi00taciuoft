CORNELII TACITI AGRICOLAE

festinatae mortis grande solacium tulit evasisse postremum
illud tempus quo Domitianus non iam per intervalla ac spira-
menta temporum, sed continuo et velut uno ic'tu rem publicam

exhausit.

45, Non vidit Agricola obsessam curiam et clausum armis
’ senatum et eadem strage tot consularium caedes, tot nobilissi-

marum feminarum exilia et fugas.

have become consul soon after, gained
triumphalia as legatus of Syria in A.D.
76, was afterwards ‘ procos. Asiae,’ and
is spoken of as dead in Plin. Pan. 89.
Trajan himself had already earned dis-
tinction in Germany before his first con-
sulship, which was in A.D. 91, two years
before Agricola's death. Presages of
him, deriving their force ‘ex eventu‚’
are mentioned in Plin. Pan. 5 ; Dio, 67.
12, 1.

apud. mauris personification, as
in many places: cp. A. 1. 31, 5, and
note. By‘ nostras' Tacitus probably
means his own.

1. festinatae. The word seems to
suggest the suspicion of foul play: cp.
A. 1. 6, 43 4. 28, 2, &c. The transitive
use follows poets and Sallust.

solacium tulin so in A. 4. 66, 1
(cp. ‘ dolorem tulit: A. 2. 84, 3), for the
more classical ‘ solacium afferre' (Cic.
Lael. 27, 104). ‘N obis‘ is to be supplied
and ‘ eum ' with ‘ evasisse’ (forming the
subject). A. takes‘ tulit’ as= ‘accepitss
and)‘ solacium' as ‘compensation' (c.

2. spiramenta,‘ pauses' (so used
apparently only here and in Ammian);
rhetorically synonymous with ‘inter-
valla': for the use of ‘per' see on
c. 2 ‚ 1.

3.9 continuo, perhaps here an adverb,
but elsewhere in Tacitus always an ad-
jective.

uno ictu, a figure perhaps suggested
by the famous wish of Gaius (Sen. de
Ira, 3. 19, 2), ‘ut populus Romanus
unam cervicem haberet, ut scelera sua

,in unum ictum. ,cogeret.'

4. exhausit‚‘ drained of its blood' :
cp. ‘ caedibus exhaustos‚' A. 12. 10, 2 ;
and ⁴ Italiam . . . hauriri,' A. 13.42‚ 7.

5. Non vidit, &c.‚,imitated from

7. charus mitius Γ, Mettius al. P2, Clarus mitius Δ, text R.

Cic. on L. Crassus (de Orat. 3. 2, 8),
‘ non vidit flagrantem bello Italiam, non
ardentem invidia senatum, non sceleris
nefarii principes civitatis reos, non
luctum filiae, non exsilium generi, ’διας
a psa ssage also apparently imitated in
Sen. Cous. ad Marc. 20, 5.

obsessam curiam. The act of Nero
at the trial of Thrasea (A. 16. 27, 1)
seems to have been repeated by Do-
mitian. For the combination ‘non ’ . . .
‘et' . ..⁸et’ . Dr. S. u. S. ᾗ 107.
The ideas are a l grouped closely.

6. eadem strage; so in the de·
nunciation of Regulus in H. ’4. 42, 5,
‘ cum . . . innoxios pueros, inlustres
senes, conspicuas feminas eadem ruina
prosterneres.’

consularium. Twelve names, most
of them certainly those of consulars,
are to be gathered from Suet. Dom.10‚
11, 15.

7. feminarum: cp. H. 1. 3, 2.
Pliny tells us (Ep.3 3. 11, 6; cp. 7.'19
4; 9. 13, 5) of Gratilla wife of Arulenus
Rusticus (c. 2, 1), Arria, widow of.
Thrasea, and her daughter Fannia, wife
of Helvidius

exilia et fugas, probably synonyms,
or perhaps the latter is a more general
term, eovering ‘relegatio’ or other less
severe forms of banishment. See notes
onA..‚;163 4.13„2&c.

carus Metius. The name in the
MSS. must be intended for that of
this famous delator, the accuser of
Senecio (see on c. 2, 1), of Fannia (Plin.
Ep. 7. 19, 5), and of many others: see
Plin. Ep. 1. 5, 3; 7. 27, 14; Mart. 12.
2 5, 5 ; Juv. 1, 36 (where the Schol. gives
some further particulars): this ‘una
victon'a’ cannot be identified.

8. censebatur, ‘was estimated.' 'a ‘z‘
post—Augustan use: see Gudeman on > ’
