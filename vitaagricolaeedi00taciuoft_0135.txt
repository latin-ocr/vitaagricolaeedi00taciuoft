ξω, with this reading (see note
below), the meaning would be that, as
the selection of strong and defensible
positions protected the forts against
being stormed or forced to capitulate,
the store of provisions made it useless
to blockade them. Peter points out that
t-he meaning is as if he had said ‘ de
