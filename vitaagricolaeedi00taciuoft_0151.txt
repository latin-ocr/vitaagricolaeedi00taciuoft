H. 1. 27, 5 it means rather ‘consilium

4. Brigantes. These are not noticed
elsewhere as taking any part in the rising
os Boudicca, and may be here mentioned
by error ; but they were hostile to Rome
at nearly that date (Α. 12. 40, 3), and
other tribes than the Iceni and Trino-
vantes are said to have joined (14.
31, 4), and it is called ‘ rebellio totius
Britanniae’ in c. 18, 4. On the other
hand they could hardly be said ⁴ exuere

ninifelieim, &c., ‘ t succ s

seems here to be meant that only gross

negligence prevented thern from annihi-

lating the army os Paulinus; and this,
though not stated in the narrative in
the Annals‚ is certainly borne out by it.

6. potuere, used as an ordinary in-
dicative with ⁴ exurere ' and ‘ expugnare,'
but with ‘ exuere ' in the sense in which

an indicative, qualified by a conditional
sentence, has (rarely in the perfect) a
subjunctive force: cp. Dr. S. u. S.
ὅ 194, 3· ‚

7. non in paenitentiam †1aturi.
Here, though the text is undoubtedly
corrupt, no emendation seems suffici-
ently unexceptionable to become gene-
rally adopted. ‘Arma laturi' and
‘ bellaturi are those which depart least
from the MSS„ but the former is open
to Wolfflin‘s objection (Philol. xxvi.
99) that they were rather already ‘ arma
ferentes ’ than ⁴ laturi,’ and it is difficult
to suppose that Tacitus wrote such a
phrase as ‘ arma ferre' or ‘ bellare in
paenitentiam! The further change ‘ in
patientiam' (cp. c. 16, 2) supplies a
better antithesis to ‘ in libertatem‚' but
it would still seem that ‘ bellare in ali-
quid,’ usually meaning ‘to make war
against’ would be used here very
ambiguously, and even misleadingly.
Peter’s readings, in the, first of which
‘bellaturis' is referred to the Romans
(who will have to fight a free, not a
previously subjected people)‚ avoid this
difficulty, but make the sentence rather
surplusage. With A's reading ‘alla-
turi ' is taken to mean ‘ who will bring
into the contest,' a sen 1c seems ⁸
0 require some further addition to the .
word or context to make it as clear as
in the other instances given by him.

8· seposuerit, ‘has kept in store':

29, 2), ‘agros . . . sepositos’ (A. 13. ·
