some think that this description may
belong to his narrative of the rising
of Boudicca, but it is more probable
that he wrote also of the time of
ClaudiuS. He was a friend of Seneca,
and probably lived οη to the time of
Trajan,

eloquentissimi. He perhaps selects
them as the most popular and best
known authors, who ‘nondum com-
perta eloquentia percoluere’ (5 1).
Caesar, whom he cites as ‘summus
auctorum' elsewhere (G. 28, 1), may
have appeared to him to be superseded,
as regards Britain, by later knowledge.

oblongae scutulae vel bipenni.
These comparisons seem to belong to
Livy and Rusticus respectively, and
may embody different ideas; but ‘vel ’
would imply that the difference was not
essential, and ‘ea figura' below seems
to apply to either. The ‘ bipennis' is
strictly the double-headed axe (see D. of
Ant. s. v.)‚ and, supposing the heads
alone to be taken account of, would
somewhat resemble two triangles united
at their apiceS. This would be in itsels
an intelligible representation of Britain
north and south of the Caledoniam
isthmus, if we could suppose that the
isthmus was known when the comparison
was made; but such a ‘bipennis' is
widely different from a ‘ scutula.' This
term (which has cognates in ‘scutra’
and ‘ scutella') is used of a kind of dish,
of a figure in tessellated pavements, of
a pattern in checkered clothing‚ &c., and
although its form is nowhere clearly
indicated, is taken generally to be 'a
four-sided figure, either rectangular or
rhomboidal, and is certainly here quali-
fied by ‘oblongae’ (which is wholly
ignored in W.’s representation of it).
This might perhaps only mean ‘ recti-
lineal four-sided‚' and a trapezium might
be intended (see C. and B.'s note). It is
possible that ‘ bipennis' is used loosely
of a simple axe-head, and we should
thus get a figure not very different from

the alternative of reading ‘sama est

mean anything else than that the report
