1. impellitur: text R.
manus Bahrens.

viously used rather as a means of
transport and supply, and by Agricola
first as an essential branch of the attack.
Its chief permanent station appears
from inscriptions to have been at
‘ portus Lemanis: Lymne in Kent. It
appears from c. 28 that Agricola had
also ships on the west coast.

1. simul. . . simu13 so in c. 36, 1;
41, 4, &c. after Vergil and Livy: cp.
Dr. S. u. S. ξ 125.

impelleretur, ‘was urged forward'
(a new phrase, akin to the sense in c.
10, 6, and perhaps suggested by mention
of ships) The manuscript text might
easily be a corruption from neglecting
an abbreviation; and W! s explanation
of it, making‘ cum . . . impellitur’ the
protasis, to which ‘ae . . . attollerent,
ac . . . compararentur’ is appended,
with ‘ Britannos . . . clauderetur' as a
parenthesis, and the apodosis not begin-
ning until ‘ad manus‚' gives a most
involved construction: while the change
of both mood and tense, in a clause so
closely coupled as ‘ ac . . . attollerent ‘
seems impossible, though somewhat
arbitrary changes of mood alone are
certainly found (cp. Weissenb. on Liv.
28. 33, 10).

2. pedes equesque, coupled closely
as the land force: ‘isdem castris’ is
local abl.

mixti copiis et laetitia. Α The
participle appears to be best taken not
quite as iu c. 4, 3, but rather as in H.
1. 9, 5 (‘nec vitiis nec viribus misce-
bantur '); the ablatives expressing that
in respect of which they were ‘mixti

different ideas A. compares ‘nox et
satietas’ (c. 37, 6), &e.

3. attollerent ι- t‚' as in
several places ιιι Hist. (1. 70, 2, &c.).

4. profunda, ‘the ravines? where
danger would lurk. The substantival
use of neuter plural adjectives, often
(as here) with a quasi· partitive genitive
following, is very common in Tacitus-

(c. 5, 23 42, 4; G. 6, 2).

Britannos quoque . . . obstupe-

ιίοιι.’ A. notes the similar conciseness
in ‘gignit et r. .margaritas,' c. 12, 6.

7. tamquam, expressing their
thoug ht,‘ as though, by the disclosnre
of thge recesses (c. 31, 4, &c.) of their
sea, their last refuge was closed against
them! The ingenious verbal coutrast
οἱι aperto’ and‘ clauderetur’ leads to
some confusion· ιιι the metaphor. Peter
suggests that an oxymoron may be
intended.

9. ad manus et arma, virtually

synonyms (c. 33, 5), the latter word

defining the former. A. gives other
passages (H. 2. 88, 53 3. 0,;5 A. 16.
26, 2, διο.) in which ’ἱιιι-ιιιιιι,ν ‘’tela.
