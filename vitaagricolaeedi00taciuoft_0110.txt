above. It seems impossible to get a satis-
factory meaning from the manuscript text
(retained by Halm and others), which
would imply that rites are inferred from
beliefs‚ instead of the reverse. The‘ s '
would easily have dropped out before
‘ sermo.’ Prof. Gudeman notes that
Tacitus does not elsewhere interpose
a verb between the members of such an
asyndet0n; hence he supports the in-
sertion of ‘ac,' dropped out after ‘ as. ’
For the meaning of‘ persuasio’ cp.
G. 45, 13 Η. 5. 5, 5. ‘Superstitio‚’

contrasted with ‘religiones' in H. 5.
131, is used often of barbarian reli—

gions (G. 39, 4; 43, 5, &c.)‚ and thus
of Judaism (H. 5. 8, 2, &c.) and Chris·
tianity (A. 15. 44, 4, and perhaps 13.
32, 3)-

1. sermo‚&c. Tacitus appears to dis—
tinguish between the language of Britain
and that of Gaul, but not between that
of any one part of Britain and another τ

in deposcendis, &c. Caesar (B. G.
3. 19, 6) and Livy (10. 28, 4) similarly
describe the courage of the Gauls.

2. ubi advenere: cp. ‘ubi pericu-
lum advenit.' Sall. Cat. 23, 6.

3. praeferunt, ‘ display' : cp. A. 4.
75, 23 16. 18, 2, δια.

5. accepimus. The reference is
probably to Caesar B. G. 6. 24, 1, cited
in G. 28, 1. On their subsequent unwar-
like character cp. A. 3. 46, 2—4; 11.
18, 1, διο.

said of the Germans (G. 6, 4) and of the
Chatti in particular (G. 3ο, 3). That
the Britons had also cavalry is seen from

These warriors are the ‘covinnarii' of ‘5'
c. 35, 3, the ‘essedarii ' of Caesar, who

describes their skill and tactim (4. 33).

That these chariots were scythed is

affirmedin Mela, 3. 6, 52 (‘ dimicant..
et curribus Gallice armatis, covinnos

vocant, quorum falcatis axibus utuntur'), ἱ,-.

and in 'Sit It. 17 7,417 (‘ incola Thales.

falcifero . . . covino’), but the silence
of Caesar and Tacitus, who describe
battles in which chariots take part, is

against the supposition that they were ·

generally such. The use of chariots at ’-
all‚ though ascribed to Gauls by other ι

writers, is noticed by Caesar as a pecu-
liarity of British warfare.

9. honestiorauriga, &c. Τ11ε general
use of‘ propngnator’ of one fighting
from a place of vantage (as a ship, wall,
διε.) seems to show that here the driver

is opposed to those who fight from the ’-

chariot, and that the meaning is that
(unlike the rule in Homer, &c.) the
former is the higher, the latter the
lower in rank. Caesar (1.1.) describes
the chariots as carrying the fighters
among the enemy's horse, and then,
while they dismount and fight, taking

position in rear to rescne them if ζ

pressed. ‘ Clientes ' is used as of those
of a Gaulish (Caes. B. G. 1. 4, 2, etc.)
