nerium, the conciseness is more continuom, and more thoroughly
a work of art3 the links omitted are generally such as can easily be
‘mpplied, and the effort of so doing, and of completing the logical

ἀρκείου, serves to arrest and interest the reader1. Here we find

‘sometimes a more spasmodic straining at brevity‚ apt to result in more
or less loss of perspicuity.

It is perhaps most of all in these harshnesses that we find the chief
,characteristic of this treatise. If it may be supposed to have been
written before the Germania, it would be a first attempt to form
a historical out ⁰f. a rhetorical style, a ‘rudis et incondita vox,' and
more or less tentative. He had parted with such advantage as the
following of Cicero had given him in the ‘Dialogusf and had hardly
formed his own style, and sometimes adonsmns which, aided
by oral emphasis or other means, are better suited to produce effect on

ἥψω than on regi-(lma² We notice in the Germania such bold

figures as ‘obstitit Oceanus 111 se inquiri ’(c. 34, 3), and such straining
aster conciseness as ‘ vallare noctem’ (c. 30, 2),- and in this treatise
such faults of style are still more prominent. For bold strokes of
rhetoric we have ‘ titulum et inscitiam rettulit ' (c. 5, 2), ‘ludos duxit '
(c. 6, 4), ‘fama aucti officii' (c. 14, 3), ‘terga occasioni patefecit'

’ᾗ (c. 14, 4), ‘eripi domos’ (c. 15, 3), ‘agitavit Britanniam disciplina ’
(c. 16, 6), ‘qui mare expectabant ' (c. 18, 5), ‘ ludere pretio ' (c. 19, 4),

‘intrepida hiems’ (c. 22, 3), ‘recessus ac sinus famae defendit'
(c. 30, 4), ‘finem Britanniae non rumore tenemus’ (c. 33, 3), ‘vota

ἱ virtusque in aperto ’ (c. 33, 4), ‘otium hausit’ (c. 40, 4), ‘in gloriam
’ agebatur’ (c. 41, 4). Among the places which a slight expansion of
Ϊ language would have saved from harshness or even obscurity are some

of those ² in which two sentences are combined in one (c. 10, 4 ; 12, 6 ;
25, 2), or in which what is left to be supplied is not clearly indicated
(αδ, 1; 21, 2; 22, 23 31, 1; 38, 53 39, 4; 44, 4),οτ in which the
idea of a qualifying word such as ‘ tantum,’ ‘ quamquam,' or ‘tamen ⁷
seems required to complete the sense (c. 10, 6 ; 16, 2 ; 17, 3), and

, such expressions as ‘ contubernio aestimaret ' (c. 5, 1), ‘invicem se ante-
