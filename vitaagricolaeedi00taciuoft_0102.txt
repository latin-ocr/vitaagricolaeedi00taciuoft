1. destinarat, generally used of an
insormal notification of purpose: the
contracted form occurs 111 A. 6. 30, 2;
Suet. Aug. .;79 Ner. 6, &c. Such omis-
sion of‘ eumss ‘se‚ '&c.‚ is character-
istic of Tacitus: cp. c. 42, 3; A i.
Introd. p. 43, §83 Gud. on Dial. 32,
8, &c.

2. subtilitatem, here ‘judicial dis-
criminationf capacity for drawing fine
distinctions.

blunt,' going on broad general lines.

3. manu, ‘by the strong 1121111,’5111ιι-,

marily· cp. ‘ubi manu agiturss G. 36, 1,
‘.ac ,agens' is coupled closely with
‘obtusior.’

non exerceat, ‘does not bring into
play) A. explains Tacitus as meaning
to say that because such legal subtlety
is not called out in military men, the
belief arises that they do not possess it.
4. naturali prudentia, ‘with native
good sense, ‘either modal abl. or abl. of

soldiers in Sall. Jug. 21, 2, Liv. 3. 10,

military force3 so the duties of the

legatus would be judicial and adminis-
trative only.
5. facile iusteque agebat, ‘dealt

. readily and equitably’: Seneca speaks

(Ep. 52, 6) os ‘ingenia facilia et ex-
peditass and Pliny (Ep. 2.13, 7) of
ingenium facile, eruditum in causis

conventus ac iudicia. Ρο5511>1γ,25 ·

Peter notes, there might be‘ indicia’ at

other times, or perhaps the words are ν

synonymous; the‘ conventus’ being the
gatherings of provincials at appointed
places where the governor administered
justice on circuit: for their organization
see Prof. Wilkins' ιιι D. of Ant. s. v.

There do not appear to be very strong ’ ’ἐ
grounds for treating the latter words .-

as a gloss. We may take the whole

sentence as saying that in all judicial :'

business he was ‘serious and eamest,
strict and yet often mereiful: i. e.
tempering strictness with compassion.
It seems better thus to take ‘ et ’ as ‘et

to supply 2 positive (as‘ saepe' or ‘ali-
