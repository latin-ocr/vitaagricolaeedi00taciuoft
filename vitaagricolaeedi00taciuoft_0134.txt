1. ingenia, &c., generally taken to
mean that he ⁴ showed a preference for
British abilities over Gallie study ' 3 i. e.
flattered them by saying that their
native wit would do for them what dili-
gent culture did for the Gauls. But
such variations of expression in Tacitus
must not be always pressed; and in the
very parallel passage in Dial. 1, 4, ‘qui
nostrorum temporum eloquentiam anti-
quorum ingeniis anteferretl no contrast
between ‘eloquentia' and ‘' mgenium'
seems intended, but ‘the achievements
of the ancients and the moderns from
both points of view are reciprocally
compared' (Gudeman); and A. seems
rightly to think a similar meaning here
intended. Tacitus might have said
simply ‘ingenia Britannorum Gallis
anteferre'3 but he wished also to bring
in the point that the Gaulish natural

gift had been cultivated and the British
had not, and to persuade the Britons to
cultivate it, not to tell them that they
were so gdod as not to need culture.
He would say that the Britons had a
natural capacity supen'or to that of the
Gauls. which however had been de-
veloped by training, and that they only
needed the same training to make them
better orators. The obscurity is due to
the straining after conciseness. The
premium set on eloquence in Gaul is
noted in Juv. 7, 148; on its spread
thence to Britain see Introd. p. 53, n. 1.

2. abnuebant. On such interposi-
tions of the indicative see A. i. Introd.
p. 56, § 49. Such clauses have the force
of a noun.

3. habitus, here ‘ dress’ (explained
by ‘ frequens toga ‘), as in several places
(c. 39, 2; G. 17, 3; 1. 48, 4;.A.1.69‚
5, &c.), though oftener in a Wlder sense
(c. 11, 23 44, 2, δια). The genit.
