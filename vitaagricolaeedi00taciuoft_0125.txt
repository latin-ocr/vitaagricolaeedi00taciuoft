sustinuitque. This text can only be

· “ sustairied by giving the conjunction an
⁴ adversative force, such as that of ‘et' ,

fin· ‘et tamen ¹ (cp. e. 9, 3, &c.). Several
hannon of such use of ‘que’ with a
meaning approaching to ‘and yet' are
‘ivm by Prof. Gudeman and in Lex.
pp. 1282, 1283; of which perhaps the

strongest are A. 2. 70, 4 (‘modera-
baturque'); 13. 10, 1 (‘sibique'); 14.
38, 4 (‘gentesque‚' where see note).
But in none of them, except perhaps the
last, is the adversative force as strong
as is here required. Nor does this force
seem sufficiently given by omitting the
conjunction and making ‘sustinuit' ad·
versative by position and emphasis.
There is thus some reason for suspecting
a lacuna, though there is nothing to
show how it might have been filled up.

Iulius Frontinus, author of the
extant treatises ‘de aquaeductis' and
‘ strategematon,' praet. urb. A. D. 70
(H. 4. 39, 1). He must have been cos.
before he was legatus of Britain; and
Borghesi infers from an inscription in
which only the letters ‘ on ' survive (see
Klein, Fasti) that he was cos. im-
mediately after Cerialis (see on c. 8, 2)
in July A. D. 74. But this would show
Britain to have been some months with-
out a legatus, and it is more probable
that he was cos. earlier, and succeeded
Cerialis in Britain early in A. D. 74.
He was ‘curator aquarum’ in A. D. 97
(‘de aq.' 102), cos. II with Trajan aster
the death of Nerva in Feb. Α. Ι). 98
(Klein), cos. 111 (again with Trajan) in
Jan. Α. D. 100 (C. Ι. L. vi. 2222, &c.).
It has been thought from his mention
of Domitian’s German war of Α. D. 85
(see on c. 39, 2) that he may have
served in it. The date of his death is
to be inserted from the fact that Pliny

' succeeded him in the augurship, pro-

bably soon after A. D. 106 (Plin. Ep. 4.
8, 6: cp. ad Trai. 13). Pliny gives also
(Ep. 9. 19, 6) his reason for prohibiting
a monument to himself.
