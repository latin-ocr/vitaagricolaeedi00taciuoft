1. Finis vitoe, &c. In these closing
cha ers there are many reminiscences
of description of the-death of the
orator Crassus, in the prooemium of
the third Book of Cic. de Orat„ as here
(2, 8), ‘fuit hoc luctuosum suis, acer-
bum patriae, grave bonis omnibus.’

epigram on the death of an Agricola is
uted by Lips. (Anth. P. 9. 549); but
we have no means of identifying its
reference.

2. vulcus . . . populus. The former
is strictly the wider term3 but they are
’ἐ &effi-m ’Ὗ Ἧ-Ἓοέιξᾞέρῗ

lun‘ and'‘plebs’ in H. 1. 35, 1.

note) in the sense of ‘ inattentive’ or

’ ffieedlesse It voum stim to

the ‘communium curarum expers popu·
lus ' of H. 1. 89, 1, the ⁴ vulgus vacuum

Agricolae' is supplied from the sense:
‘loqui ⁹ has the meaning of ‘ in ore ha-'
bere'in H. 1.5o,3; 4. 12,1; A. 16.22‚ 2.

5. oblitus. lt is perhaps better to
treat the repeated ‘ est ' as dittography
thau to alter it to ‘ et ’ or set.’

8. principis Urs.

6. interceptum (sc. ‘ fuisse '), used
with ‘veneno’ in A. 3. 12, 7, and often
of other kinds of treacherous death.

nobis, &c. The manuscript text would
mean ‘1 may venture to say that we have
uo ascertained evidence '; and perhaps
this is what Tacitus, speaking for the
family, intended to say. The expres-
sion (frequent in Livy, διο.) would be
stronger than a mere admission (‘fa-
teor '), but still leaves it open to any
one to believe the ‘ rumor! Cicero (ad
Fam. 5. 5, 2) uses a more natural
expression, ‘audivi‚ nam comperisse
me non audeo dicere! The insertion
of ‘nec’ or ‘ut’ would leave a more
decided impression that he believed it.
Suetonius does not mention Agricola
among Domitian's victims, but Dio (66.
20, 3) gives the fact (ἐσφάγη) as un-
doubted. A similar belief as to the
cause of the death of Germanicus is
admitted by Tacitus to have been not
only unproved but highly improbable
(see A. 3. 14, ας 19, a).

7. ceterum, passing on to known
facts which might give some support to
the rumour.

per omnem valetudinem, ⁴ through-
out his illness': cp. c. 45, ff ‘per
omnes valetudinis eius dies, A. 4.
8, 2.

8. principatus . . . visentis = ‘ prin-
cipum . .. visentium? The point of
the sentence is that princes, who always
pay such visits of inquiry through
messengers‚ do not usually pay them
so osten.
