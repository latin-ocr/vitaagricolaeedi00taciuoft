brought together, and their value critically estimated.
Ι can only claim to have consulted such as seemed
most likely to throw light on points arising out of
the narrative of Tacitus. Among these have been
J. C. Bruce's great work on the Wall (third ed„ 1867),
and his Handbook (fourth ed., 1895), the history of
Cumberland by Chancellor Ferguson (1890), and that
of Northumberland by Mr. C. J. Bates (1895), and for
Scotland the surveys of the northern ‘vallum' by
Horsley (1732) and General Roy (about 1764) ¹, also
R.. Stuart's ‘Caledonia Romana' (second ed., 1852),
the general history of J. H. Burton (1873), and the
‘Celtic Scotland' of Mr. W. F. Skene (1876). On
Britain generally I have often been indebted to the
information collected by Hubner in the prefatory
notes to various sections of C. I. L. vii. I have also to
refer to notes on special points by Mr. F. Haverfield 2.

It is to be feared that those who are familiar with

above and many other works to identify particular
sites with the line of march or battle-ground of Agri-

these pages: but it has been my chief aim to show
how little support any theories of the kind can derive
from the narrative of ‚ Tacitus or from other corrobora-
tive evidence, and to make it plain that it is only
in the barest outline that Agricola’s campaigns are
traceable ³.

I had hoped to make this volume a counterpart in its
scale and mode of treatment to that on the Germania,
