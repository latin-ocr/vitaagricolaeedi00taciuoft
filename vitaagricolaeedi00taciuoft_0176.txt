Agricolae, quo coheredem optimae uxori et piissimae filiae

1. med. primi et lib. intimi Ern.

3. constabant: text R.

4. animo

<habitu Em„ sermone Mohr, ore Ritt.) vultuque: text Bahrens.

1. primi . . . intimi. It need not
be supposed that the order of these
adjectives has got reversed; as we have
elsewhere ‘praecipuos libertorum ' (A.
6. 38, 2) and ‘medicus . . . frequens
secretis’ (A. 4. 3, 5).

sive, &c., ‘ whether that action meant
interest (cp. ξ 1) or espionage ' (cp.
c. 2, 3), i. e. watching the symptoms,
to see if all was going on as they
wished. The text has been suspected,
and ‘ cura’ has been strained to mean
‘ pretended interest‚' but Tacitus may
have wished to put the possibility of its
reality, without himself believing it.
A. compares the account of Piso’s mes-
sengers during the illness of Germanicus
(A. 2. 60, 5); ‘incusabantur‚ nt vale-
tudinis adversa rimantes.' For the use
of ‘illud ' cp. A. 1. 49, 43 4. 19, 3‚&c.‚
and note on c. 21, 3.

2. momenta, ‘turning points’ (cp.
‘ brevibus momentis summa verti,' A. 5.
4, 2), the stages of his sinking.

3. cursores, couriers posted at in-
tervals, >probably to his Alban villa
c. 45, 1 .
( constabat, as also ‘constat‚’ is uni-
formly impersonal in Tacitus. The
imperfect is adapted to the time at
which the evidence existed; as in ξ 4;
c. 38, 2, &cn see note on A. 13. 35, 3.

nullo credente, ‘ and none believed
that news brought with such despatch
could be unwelcome-²

4. speeiem, &c. ‘Speciem prae se
tulit' must refer to something outward,
and it seems impossible to take ‘animo‚’
with W. and K., to refer to other out-
ward expressions as distinet from those
of eountenance; the more so as ‘ animus’
is elsewhere clearly distinguished from

‘ vultus’ as the inward feeling from the
outward expression (cp. H. 1. 85, 43
4. 31, 33 Sall. Jug. 113, 33 Plin. Ep.
7. 1, 6), and even sharply opposed
to it, as ‘laetitiam . . . vultu ferens,
animo anxius' (H. 2. 65, 1). of the
emendations, that adopted is the sim-
plest, as an assimilation of ‘ animi ’ to
the case of ‘vultu' would cause the
insertion of the conjunction, and Gude-
man well supports the reading ftom
Cicero, Verr. 1. 8, 21 (‘ animi dolorem
vultu tegere '), and still more from
Curt. 6. 9, 1 (¹ vultu praeferens dolorem
animi ’), The combinations ‘ habitu'
or ‘sermone vultuque’ are well sup-
ported from Tacitus, but involve greater
departure from the MSS.

5. securus . . . odii, ‘relieved from
hatred,’ no longer troubled by it: .
the use with ‘casuum' (H. 1. 86, ἓξ,
‘ pelagi’ (Verg. Aen. 7, 304), ‘poenae’ -
(Hor. Ep. 2. 2, 17). διο.

et qui, ‘ and being such as to ἐ .
c. 30, 6; also ‘et cui . . . placerent,' ig.
2. 2 5, 2.

7. coheredem . . . scrip-it. It be-
came a common practice under bad
emperors thus to sacrifice a part of the
property to save the rest for the rela-
tives. Gaius exacted this (Suet. Cal.
38), and some famous instanoes are
given under Nero in which this was
done or recommended to be done (A.
14. 31, 13 16. 11, 2). Tiberius refused
such legacies (A. 2. 48, 2), as did at
first Domitian (Suet. Dom. 9), though
afterwards seizing them eagerly (Id. 2 1),
so that Pliny speaks of him (Pan. 43)
as ‘unus omnium, nunc quia scriptus,
nunc quia non scriptus, heres?
