No. 3429) and is here quoted as r¹. It is written on paper, with 3³

much apparent care, and is further enriched by many interlinear and
marginal corrections, the value of which it is somewhat difficult to
estimate. In three cases only has he expressly given a conjecture of
his own, distinguished by the words ‘ puto,' or ‘ sic legendum puto ’Β
In about nineteen other cases he adds to the correction ‘al ' (probably
for ‘ aliter ')‚ which might in some cases mean that the exemplar could
also be so read ³, in most others might refer (as Wex thinks) to the .
reading of another MS„ or (as is more generally thought) to con-
jectures which he wished to distinguish from his own as those of
others ⁴. The remainder, comprising the larger part of the corrections,
are given without any distinguishing mark. In several of them, where ’
the corrected reading agrees with that of the other MS„ he is probably
only rectifying upon revision the errors of the pen in his own original
transcript⁵: the others are thought to be probably reproductions
without comment of similar interlineations or marginal notes in the
exemplar before him. It is not therefore necessary to suppose that
his transcript was made from more than one MS.

It is no doubt an· advantage to have the work before us of so
distinguished a scholar as Laetus 3 and although in some cases he
may have followed his original less closely than an unlearned scribe
would have done ⁶, his transcription remains and must remain our
chief authority for the text.

Only one other MS. (here designated as A), also preserved in the
Vatican (No. 4498), is in existence. It is assigned to much the same
date as Γ, the latter part of the fifteenth century, and is a parchment
MS. containing several short treatises by various authors, among them
also the Germania and ‘ Dialogus,’ and, though rarely thought worth
quoting by editors of those works, has to be taken more account ofin
