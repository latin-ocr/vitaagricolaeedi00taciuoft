seems different from other instances of
‘invicem se' (cp. Gudeman on Dial.
25, 23), and to be one in which clear·
ness is sacrificed to conciseness; as it
is only by the help of the context that
we could tell that ‘ se anteponendo’
means ‘ ponendo ante se.’ The variation
of the MSS. may argue that the original
text was obscure3 but >⁸ appetendo’
would give a very weak sense.

Here the connecting link is much more
difficult to supply than in the other
instances, but appears to be that the
superiority which each assigned to the
other was equally deserved by both.
The sentence is also in itself obscure
from conciseness, but appears to mean
that, as a bad wife is more blamed than
a bad husband (for she has uo other
capacity in which she can redeem her-
self), so a good wife deserves higher
praise than a good husband (as being
perfect in the chief sanction of her lise').
See A’s note.

5. sors quaesturae, &c. One of
the quaestors of the year was allotted
as vicegerent to the proconsul of each
senatorial province. L. Salvius Otho
Titianus, the brother of the emperor
Otho, aud prominent in the first two
Books of the Histories, had been consul
A. n. 52 (A. 12. 52, ι), and it appears
§.see A's note) that his proconsulship of

sia must have fallen in the year 816-
817, Α. D. 63-64. Agricola must there-
fore have been quaestor in the latter
year3 and would, as Urlichs (p. 13)
shows, have served only a part of the
year under Titianus, and the remainder
under the upright Antistius Vetus (see
on A. 16. 10, 2).
