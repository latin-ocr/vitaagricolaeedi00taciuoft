them thus. ‘ Deesse' is taken with
‘avaritiam' in a sense nearer to ‘ ab·
esse.

1. Ipsi Britanni. A. notes that
these¹ sentences describing the character
of the Britons as' subjects lead up to the
accoimt of their subjugarim, and ‘ipsi ’
is similarly used in G. 2, 1 in a transition
from the country to the people. K. makes
the transition here to be from the natural
rewards of conquest to the payments
by subjects.

2. munera, ‘ obligations ¹ (i.e. requisi-
tions, &c.) enjoined by the government
(cp. ¹ omni publico munere solverentur ⁷
A. 1¹2. 58, 1) ; distinct from ‘munia
imperii,’ which would be ‘functions of
government’ (cp. H. 1. 77, 1, &c.). On
such requisitions see c. 15, 2-4; 19, 4;
3²2 5·

obeunt, used elsewhere with ‘munia ’
by Tacitus, and with ‘ munera ' by
Livy (2. 8, 43 3. 6* 9), and sufficiently
applicable by zeugma to the two more
ῗρεοίειΙ terms to make correction need-

ess

si iniuriae absint. The subjunctive
is best taken (with A.) as potential : cp.
c. 31, 1, and ‘quae‚ ni adsit modus, in
exitium vertuntur' H. 3. 86, 3 (where
see Her'aus); also Dr. S. u. S. 5 190.

3. igitur, here noting the beginning
of a relation of the state of things already
indicated by ‘ domiti': cp. c. 29, 2, A.
1. 31, 4; 12. 24, 2515. 72, 4, &c-

primus omnium, &c. Pompeius is
ῗ-(Ι) spoken of in relation to the Jews in

6. ostendisse, ‘to have pointed the
attention of posterity to it, not handed

it down as a possession)

ment of the result achieved by Caesar

is correct. He had shown that Britain
could be invaded, and that (as in Gaul)
the disunion of its tribes could be turned
to account, and he had done no more.
But such expressions as ‘litore potitus
sit ’ suit his first futile expedition rather

than his second, in which he crossed the ἶ

Thames. The ‘ bis penetrata Britannia ¹

of Vell. 2. 47,ι 1, errs 'equally on the

other side, far more so Florus (3. 10, 18),-

who speaks of him as ‘ Britannos Cale-
donias secutus in silvas'3 but on the
whole, subsequent writers appear to
depreciate his exploit (see A. ii. Introd.
. 128' n. . ,
p 7. e't, eggrying on the idea of ‘bella

ceptum, ⁴ an injunction. That Tiberius j

regarded the practice of Augustus in

this light, is given as acknowledged by*

himself (A. 4. 37, 4; cp. also 1. 77, 4).
Augustus had more than once professed
an intention to invade Britain, but had
really preferred to gain influence there
by diplomacy (see Introd. p. 35, A. ii.
Introd. pp. 127 foll.), and dissuaded his
successors from extending, the empire
(A. 1. 11, 7). The supposed reference
to Livy, as speaking of him as ‘ regressus

a Britannia' (see Weissenborn on Liv. ν

Epit. 135), is probably an error.
