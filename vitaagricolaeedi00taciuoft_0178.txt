bonum virum facile crederes, magnum libenter.

CORNELII TACITI AGRICOLAE Ι

'let ipse-‹gui- θ’

dem, quamquam medio in spatio integrae aetatis ereptus,

quantum ad gloriam, longissimum aevum peregit.

quippe et

vera bona, quae in virtutibus sita sunt, impleverat, et consulari
5 ac triumphalibus ornamentis praedito quid aliud adstruere

3. opibus . . .

26, 23 H. 1. 51, 3, &c. A. takes it
here to mean ‘prevailed,’ as in A. 3.
47, 1·

1. bonum, &c.‚ ‘y
believe him to be a good, and not
unwillingly to be a great man ’ ; i.e. his
personal appearance did not belie his
reputation.

ou would read ily

ipse, ‘he himselfi’ as distinct from >

his ‘habitus’2 cp. ‘ipsi Britanni,' c
13, 1.

2. integrae aetatis, apparently best
taken, with W.‚ as not a partitive
genitive, but qualitative, and explana-
tory of ‘medio‚' ‘in the midst of his
career, while yet in unimpaired life!
‘Medio spatio' is thus used of life in
a passage followed in many places here
(Cic. de Orat. 3. 2, 7), and ‘integra
aetas’ is used of Tiberius at a consider-
ably more advanced age (Suet. Tib. ιο),

'integra iuventa ' of Agrippina at about
thirty· -three (A. 12. 2, 3)

3. quantum ad, as„ sar as *con-
cern—ed' (‘ quantum attinet ad ); ⁰36
used' ιιι G. 21 ,33 H. 5. 10, 3; perhaps
from Ov. A. A. 1. 744 (‘q uantum ad
Pirithoum ')‚ or Sen. Ep. 85, 14. The
{longelst life could have added nothing to

is o .

ᾳξὰρῑζθ, &c. To interpret this pas·
sage as it stands, we should have to make
the meaning somewhat as follows : ‘ his
glory was as complete as if he had lived
out his day s; for he had realized to the
full (so‘ ‘impletum est consiliumss H. 1.
16, 9ςι ‘summum fastigium impleret‚'’
Plin. Ep. 2. 1, 2, &c.‚) the onlytruebless-
ings (according to the Stoic creed. cp.
H. 4. 5, 3, &c.), and as to fortune'sgifts
he was a consular and‘ ‘triump halisl'
He cared not for excessive‚ nor phad he
splendid wealth (and was thereby all
the less imperilled); he did not die a
widower or childless, and he escap ed
the evil days to come! The connexion
is often* ιιι places very obscure; and the

fullest discussion of the questions raised

contigerant aster peregit Gudeman.

4. sunt om. Δ.

is that of Prof. Gudeman. One leadintg “
difficultyis that‘ opibus.. .contigernnt
appears irrelevant, and such an ex
tion as is given above, or any other, has
to be wholly supplied by the reader·
another, that‘ filia . . . superstitibus'
cannot be taken with the preceding, nor
without difficulty (but see note below)
with the following words: while the
proposal to read ‘filiae atque uxori}
with‘ contigerant, gives a meaning that
needs further words to make it clear.
The transposition suggested by Prof.
Gudeman still appears to leave some
difficulty; as we should rather expect
{specim-{ae non conthigerarrdt' to tliae. sol-
owe some suc wor as· men‘
than by‘ ‘yquippess · also‘filia..su13er-
stitibus’ would have a clearer meaning
by coming close after‘ praedito. ’ Very
possibly there is some deeper seated
corruption in the passag ge than we have
the means of remedy ying. Prof. Gude—
man seems right in disagreeing with the
general consensus which has followed
Γ111 in omitting the‘ non ’‘with con-
tigerant.¹ If we had‘ satis amplae) or
other such words stating that handsome
or sufficient means had fallen to Agri-
cola’s lot, there would be much to be
said for the omission, but ‘ ‘osae’
is a much strong-er word (cp. ‘opibus
speciosus, ’.A 3. 55, 3); and the facts
that his maternal goods were plaudet-ed
(c.7‚ 1) and his paternal probably eon-
fiscated (c. 4, ι), that his official lise
was without greed (c. 9, 4), that the
proconsular salary was not given to him
(c. 42, 3), and that the authorities fol·
lowed by Dio (66. 20, 3) make him
live in poverty (ἐνδείᾳ, are strongly
against the supposition t t he was rich.
5. adstruere, ‘to add’ cp. ‘tam-
quam nobilitatem adstruerent, H. 1.
78, 3. This sense, found also in Veu„
Plin. ma. and mi.‚ seems to occur first
in Ov. A. A. 2, 119 (‘ animum . . . ad-
strue formae ’)‚
