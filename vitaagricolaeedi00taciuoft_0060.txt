any earlier work. On the other hand, the testimony of Tacitus is ¹

  

most explicit, and it is but natural to suppose that the first Roman ¹
general who reached the place would have seen its great advantage ,
as a means of communication from sea to sea, and would have made ¹
a road across it, secured in some sort by fortifications, which might

have been afterwards wholly obliterated by stronger works.

His road

would no doubt be of the nature of a ‘ limes¹‚' but that it was intended
to be not a boundary but a fresh base for further advance ², is evident Ι
from the history of the succeeding campaigns. It was no doubt
supported at each end by naval stations ³.

The narrative of A. n. 82⁴ is mainly taken up with the design os ³

conquering Ireland, and again is full of difficulty.

Urbicum vicit legatum alio muro ces·
pititio summotis barbaris ducto! This
emperor's name is frequent in inscrip—
tions along the line, and that also of
Urbicus occurs (C. Ι. L. vii. 1 125). The
work, popularly called ‘ Graham's Dyke‚'
appears to have been about 34 miles
long, from Carriden to West Kilpatrick
(or perhaps extending to Dumbarton),
and, though much less strong than the
southern wall, to have consisted of a
great ditch, thought to have been 40 feet
wide and 20 deep, and south of it a val-
lum of earth or turf sods (with founda-
tions of stone where ready to hand), and
behind both a road. In the time of
Horsley and Roy (the middle of the
last century) ten stations or camps
appear to have been traceable, and some
more probably existed in the eastern
part where no traces remain. In one or
two places there appear to have been
also traces of smaller ‘ castella’ or
watchtowers. Some twelve places on
it have furnished inscriptions, and much
of the information respecting it is col-
lected by Hiibner in C. 1. L. vii. p. 191,
foll.
