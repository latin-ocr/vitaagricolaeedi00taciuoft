152 CORNELII TACITI AGRICOLAE

following words, in which the stress is
laid on ‘ secreto‚’ ‘ feeding his hatred in
his usual reserve’ (cp. c. 22, 5). His
periods of retirement and brooding are
spoken of in Plin. Pan. 48, and his se·
clusion in his Alban villa (c. 45, 1) in
many places.

1. in praesentia, for the more com-
mon ‘ in praesens ⁷ (A. 1. 4, 1, &c.) ς the
case is best taken as abl. sing, as it
clearly is in Sen. Ep. 52, 15 ; 72, 1.

2. reponere, ‘to store up’; not at
present to betray it : cp. the description
of the habit of Tiberius, ‘ odia recondere
auctaque promere ' (A. 1. 69, 7), and his
‘ animus revolvens iras ' (A. 4. 21, 2).

impetus . . . languesceret: cp. ‘ im-

petus offensionis languerat,' A. 4. 21, 2 ς
also A. 12. 12, 33 H. 3. 58, 6.
Nipp. (Rh. Mus. xviii.
362, foll.) considers these words to be
a gloss, as standing in no proper cansal
relation to the preceding sentence, where
we should rather expect some such
words as ‘donec Agricola rediret.’ But
the sentence seems related to the subject
of the next chapter, and might be under·
stood with reference to something im-
plied, as that he did not dare to strike
while Agricola’s glory and popularity
with the army continued, and that these
could not be expected to abate, while
he remained in the province.

4. triumphalia ornamenta, called
also ‘triumphalia insignia‘ (A. 1. 72,
1, δια), the only triurnphal honour
given to those not belonging to the
imperial family, apparently from and
after B.c. 14 (Dio, 54. 24, 8). The
term is analogous to ‘ consularia,’ ‘ prae-
toria ornamenta‚' διο. (fictions by which

the title and dignity of an office was
given without the office itself), and en-
titled a person to be styled‘tn'umphalis'
(A. 3. 30, 4, &c.), and to wear the
‘ toga picta,’ ‘tunica palmata‚’ διο. The
distinction went out of custom aster
the time of Hadrian (Staatsr. i. 466).
That Agricola received it from Titus
seems an error of Dio (66. 20, 3).

inlustris statuae, also called ‘statua '

triumphalis’ (H. 1. 79, 8) or ‘laureata’
(A. 4. 23, 1). Augustus instituted the
custom of placing such in his Forum
(Dio, 55. 10, 3), and the honour, though
distinct from the ‘ornamenta,’ usually
accompanied them : see Staatsr. i.

‘quidquid aliud,’ and in the passage

multo verborum houm-93 so again
in H. 4. 4, 3. The repetition of ⁴ honore'
after ‘ honorem ' may be intentioni, to
point the eontrast3 or may be an inad-
vertence: see note on A. 1. 81, 1.

6. decerni . . . iubet. Such honours
are decreed by the senate, butusually
on the initiative of the princeps.

addique, &c. Probably (as A.
explains it) the decree was so worded
as to hint at further honours in con·
templation, and the fact that Syria was
vacant suggested that this government
was meant. ‘ Iubet' is taken strictly
with ‘ decerni ’ and loosely with ‘ addi.

8. Atilii Rufi. A military diploma
shows that T. Atilius Rufus was in
Α. D. 80 legatus of Pannonia.
