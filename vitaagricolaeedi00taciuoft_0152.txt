subject of hope of success, begun in
c. 31, 4, is carried on throughout this
chapter.

1. dissensionibus et discordiis,
synonyms, so coupled in Dial. 40, 4:
on the fact cp. c. 12, 2.

2. vertunt, ‘they turn ' or employ, ·
so ‘ ad gloriam vertebat‚’ A. 2. 84, 2.

4. nisi si, used to put a probable
supposition inG. 2, 2; A. 6. 25, 1; 15.
53, 5: in Cic. Cat. 2. 4, Quint 4. 1, 70,
as here, it puts ironically a supposition
dismissed as impossible, and m all these
cases ‘si‘ is questioned.

5. pudet dictu. Dr. notes this as
here alone used for ‘ pudendum dictu’
(H. 2. 61, 1, &c.) or ‘pudet dicere? On
the Britons in this Roman army see
c. 2 , 2.

6.9 commodent, ‘ lend ’; this emenda-
tion is supported by ‘ nomen . . . com-
modavisse' (A. 15. 53, 5), ‘vires . . .
commodando ' (Liv. 34. 12, 5), &c.

diutius, who have been much longer;
i. e. are more deeply imbued with the
seelings of enemies.

7. adfectu, ‘attachment': cp. ‘militia
sine adfectu ' (H. 4. 31, 2), and Mayor
on Juv. 12, 10; who notes it as a silvei·
age use. A similar state of feeling
ιιιὲιοές auxiliaries is referred to in H. 4.

φ ι
⁷ metus ao terror, ‘to feel sear and to
inspire it.’ ‘Est’ is retained by some
with the sense ‘exists between them';

6. commendent. text P. 7. est.

11. ex probaturi 1¹,expro-

but with it we should expect ⁸ vinclum?
The verb need not be expressed, but it

seems easier to suppose ‘'est and‘ sunt’

confused in compendia than the former ι,

ἰηιειροΙαυεᾱ.

infirma vinela caritatis, a bitter ’

litotes, as such are not really bonds of
affection at all, but the reverse.

9. victoriae incitamenta, ‘ineen-
tives to victory’: thus the wives and
children present are ealled‘ hortamenta
victoriae ιιι H. 4. 18,4 4. The British
women were thus resent in the battle

German custom is described· mG
8,1,and that of the Thracians m A.
51, 2.

‘coniuges‚’ *parentes' patrias in the
appeal of Civilis (H. 5. 17, 4).

11. aut nulla, &c.‚ ‘most ofthem
have no home or an alien home’ (not
that for which they fight). Similar

terms are used of the ‘colluvies’ of

slaves in A. 14. 44, 5, ‘quibus.
tema sacra aut nulla sunt.' So here
many might be said to have no‘ patria?
