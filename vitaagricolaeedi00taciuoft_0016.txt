problems as Ι have here attempted has had to be
written with hardly any assistance from previous
editors. This will, it is hoped, excuse both the
length to which it has extended and the shortcomings
which cannot fail to appear in it.

portion than any other part of Tacitus which 1 have
edited; but the time will have been well spent if
I have been able to give more substantial assistance
to students of so unique a specimen of ancient litera-
ture, and one of such exceptional interest to English
readers.
