These distinctions, resting, it will be observed‚ on physical charae·
teristics only, and taking no account of language, have received much
attention in the light of recent researches, but have perhaps had too
much stress laid on them. As the two peoples must have been so
well known, we may take it that they are correctly described, and were
so diametrically opposed to each other that they could not have had
a comm-on origin. But the alleged resemblance of Caledonian to
German and Silurian to Iberian, even supposing it to rest 011 the
authority of Agricola himself, may not be founded on more than
superficial observation. Agricola had in his army many Gauls‚ and
also subjected Germans, as Batavians and Tungrians ⁶, and may have
thought that his Caledonian antagonists and prisoners approached
more nearly to the latter than the former type. But the physical
difference between Celt and German was not to Roman eyes strongly
marked⁷; and a ruder and less civilized tribe of the former might
