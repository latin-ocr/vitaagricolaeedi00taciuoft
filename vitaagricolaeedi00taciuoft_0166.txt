tenuit, ‘took up its position in';
a nautical term often in Livy (22. 22, 2 ;
28. 18, 12, &c.).

11. unde, &c. With this reading,
‘unde’ is taken only with ‘lecto,' the
sense being ‘ quo, litore inde lecto,
redierat' : ‘ starting from whence it had
coasted along all the adjoining side of
Britain, and to which it had retumed.'
Clearness is, as often, sacrificed to con-
ciseness. Peter compares A. 15. 43, 3,
&c. The voyage would thus be sup-
posed to have taken place between the
date of the command issued (§ 4) and
the winter, i. e. during the indefinite
time occupied by his ‘lentum iter. ’
Madvig supposes that it could not have
taken place so late in the season (cp.

‘exacta aestate ’,) and that the fleet was
collected there to make the voyage next
spring. But the season of the year is
confirmed by ‘ hiems adpetebat ’ (c. 10,
6), and the time required need not have
been long3 as it w‘ould be sufficient to
establish the insularity of Britain if they
reached any point already known (such
as the F irth of Clyde or perhaps further
north) on the western coast3 and the
descent on the Orkneys and sighting

‘'Thule (c. 10, 6) would not be a great
divergence; but the weather must have
been exceptionally favourable if they
were endangered by no autumnal storms.
That Tacitus should mention the sub-
ject so cursorily is explained by Agri-
cola's having taken no personal share
in the voyage; in a general history we
should expect a more circumstantial
account of it.

2. epistulis. Probably only one de-
spatch was sent in the year (cp. c. 18, 7);
but Tacitus very frequently uses this
plural (as ‘litterae’ is always used) of
a single letter.

auctum. ‘ Actum’ in this con-
text could only mean ‘ performed ';
‘auctum ' can be used in the sense of

‘exaggerated’ with‘ euncta' (A. 2. 82, 1)
and other words implying statements3
so possibly here with‘ rerum cmum'
in the pregnant sense of‘ 'the news of
this course of events.’

ut Domitiano moris erat, for
‘Domitianus, ut ei moris erat,' an
attraction apparently due to straining
after conciseness. ‘Moris est’ is thus
followed by a dative in c. 42, 5; G.
13 ις Quint. 1.1‚‘13( plerisque moris
est '), more commonly by genit.‚ as
’ἓιοόι-ἰὸε est Graecorum' (Cic. Verr. ii. 1.

derisui fixisse. This dative ex-
pressing that which a thing (or person)
serves as or occasions, ,or redicative
dative (Roby 1158), most equent in
words in ‘ui‚' and especially used with
the verb ‘esse‚’ is common in Tacitus.
See A. i. Introd. p. 47, 5 23. This
word is so used in Phaedr. Ι. 11, 2, but
only here by Tacitus.

4. falsum . . . triumphum. Do-
mitian is generally believed to have
triumphed twice for successes in Ger-
many ;the former occasion (that here
referred to) being after the exp edition
against the Chatti, dated by good evi-
dence (see Gsell)' in Α. D. 83 (‘ nuper’ is
used of an event a year ago in c. 32, 4),
when the frontier was advanced and
secured in the Taunus district (see
Momms. Hist. v. 136, E. T. i. 150), the
other, the ⁴ duplex de Chattis Dacisque
triumphus'of Suet. Dom. 6, where (un—
less the Chatti are confounded with the
Marcomani) it may be* imp lied that they
were chastised for their palliance with
Antonius Saturninus. This Gsell shows
reasons tor placing about Nov. 89. In
Eus. Chron. (‘ Domitianus de Dacis et
Germanis triumphavit ') and in Suet.
