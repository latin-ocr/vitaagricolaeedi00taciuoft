coloniae, perhaps a rhetorical plural
referring only to Camulodunum (Col-
chester). Inscriptions show Glevum
(Gloucester)‚ Lindum (Lincoln)‚ and
Eburacum (York), to have become at
some time colonies, the first of them

8. inter, often used with the force of
an abl. abs. or causal sentence, as ‘ inter
