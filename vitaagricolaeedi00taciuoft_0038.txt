In several of these passages many critics have insisted that the .

words are corrupt, and have proposed corrections; and it must be
admitted that the weakness of our MSS„ and the undoubted cor-

ruptions contained in them, cast a general uncertainty over the text

delivered to us. On the other hand, in several of the above-mentioned
instances the reading has not been seriously questioned, and to admit
these is to weaken the force of the objections to others, and to
strengthen the misgiving that we may be endeavouring to correct not
the scribe but the author.

such as are mentioned by him or by earlier authors, or those of such localities
as we have some ground of evidence or probability for believing to have been
occupied in or before this date. Thus the lines from Clyde to Forth are inserted,
those of the Great Wall omitted. 1 have indicated a few os the chief roads, on
the supposition that some at least of them must have been constructed during

the probable limits.

The small map in the margin illustrates the geographical and ethnological ideas
of c. 10-11.

IN no other of his extant works has Tacitus given any general
account of Britain and its people; and this circumstance, added to his
exceptional means of knowledge through his father—in-law, has made
