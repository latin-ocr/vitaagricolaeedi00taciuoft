asperitas, &e.; so Caesar says (Β. G.
5. 12, 7), ‘ loca sunt temperatiora quam
in Gallia, remissioribus frigoribus ’3 his
comparison being, no doubt, that of
southern Britain with northern Gaul.
Strabo also (4. 5, 2, 200) speaks of the
weather as rainy and misty rather than

snowy. We should have expected
Tacitus, in the light of his knowledge
of the northern parts, to speak less
generally.

dierum spatia, &c. Tacitus, like
Juvenal (2, 16), speaks only of the long
summer, not of the short winter days.
Caesar (B. G. 5. 13, 3), Strabo (2. 1, 18,
75, quoting Hipparchus), and Pliny
(N.H. 2. 75, 77, 186) have some informa-
tion as to both: Caesar, when in Britain,
had verified the greater length of the day
by a clepsydra ; Pliny comes very near

Italy, seventeen·in Britain (which would
be about a medium between London
and the north of Scotland).

1. nostri orbis, ⁴ our clime ' : cp. G.
2, 1; Plin. N. H. 12. 12, 26, 45; also
‘ thalamos alieni concipis orbis’ (Ov.
M. 7, 22), and ‘in alium orbem paras
ire’ (Curt. 9. 3, 8). ‘Dierum' is
omitted sor conciseness: cp. c. 24. 2.

2. ut . . . internosces, potential
(cp. c. 22, 5), ‘ so that you would draw
little distinction between evening and
morning twilight' (the one passes into
the other).

4. occidere et exsurgere. Peter
seems right in keeping ‘ solis fulgorem '
as subject (not supplying ‘ solem '). The
actual sun is below the horizon, but
only casts a low shadow. ‘Et,' after
‘nec' (cp. c. 1, 3) couples two parts

reach to the sky and stars.’ The theory
implied is that the earth is a disc snr-

rounded by a belt of ocean (cp. G. 17. ⁴
2 ; 45, 1 l, that the night is a shadow from '

the sun beneath the earth (cp. Plin. N. H.

2. 10, 7, 47), and that at the limit of the.

earth the shadow cast is so low that the
sky is unaffected by it, and therefore not
hidden from the earth. 1t is diffieult to

suppose Tacitus ignorant of the spheri· =

cal form of the earth, known to scientific ’-

Greeks from the fourth century Β. c.and
to such Romans as Cicero, Seneca, and
Pliny : but his language does not seem
able to be explained as merely rhe-
torical and popular, though ‘erigunt’
has a figurative subject (as in G. 27, 23
H. 5. 6, 4). He is perhaps followed
by Eumenius, who says of Britain (Pan.
1⁹33 ‘flfflsstifissitssssfflr,lfflffindff
tollit umbras, noctisque metam caeli et
siderum transit aspectus, ut sol ipse, qui
nobis videtur occidere, ibi appareat
praeterire.' Cp. also Jom. Get. 3, 21,
‘et quod nobis videtur sol ab imo
{3{{3{?1;;‡{¹{,§‡⁰e.{fflfflmtfflzssssz
circuire.’ ‘ Sidera ' seems more specific
than ‘ caelum’ (cp. Gudeman on Dial.
16, 29) and the two are thus conpled in
Liv. 24. 34, 2.

7. praeter, ‘except ἐ cp. ‘praeter
fagum atque abietem, Caes. B. G. 5.12, 5.
